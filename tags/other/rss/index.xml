    <title>So... YouTube Enabled Unskippable Ads Without Asking Me</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm furious. </p>
<p>I never wanted to add unskippable ads. </p>
<p>Don't know exactly when this happened. Worst part is there's no option to batch remove the ads, so I had to go one by one to disable them. I think I got them all but <strong>if you find a video of mine with unskippable* ads please contact me so I can remove them.</strong></p>
<p>I only found out because I was turning off monetization for an outdated video and noticed it was on. I had seen lately that there had been a drop in views/revenues lately which I thought was a bit odd, but put it down to one of those random fluctuations, or maybe because I wasn't posting as frequently, but looking at my timeline now it's quite clear it was the unskippable ads.</p>
<p>So, sorry for everyone who suffered through that.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the future I can make enough of patreons and donations that I can disable them completely, but for now, unfortunately, I need the money to buy materials for projects, etc.</p>
<p>*I believe "unskippable" ads below the 5 second skip timer don't count. It's if they're longer than that.</p>]]></content>
