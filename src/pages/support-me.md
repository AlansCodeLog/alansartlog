If you want to support me:

I take commissions ([contact me](http://alansartlog.com/contact)) on just about anything you might have seen me do (sketches, paintings, 3d models, etc). I'm also a programmer as I've mentioned. I built this website myself, and you can find me on github as [AlansCodeLog](https://github.com/AlansCodeLog) if you want to see some of what I can do (though I don't have any of the bigger WIP electron projects I'm working on there).

I've also set up a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alansartlog) if you want to support me that way, or if you don't like patreon or want to make a one time donation, you can also support me through [paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=R2M9MS6NDCQ4J). I'm also willing to take crypto if anybody wants to donate that way, but I haven't set anything up yet.

**Otherwise, the best way to support me is to share my work.**
