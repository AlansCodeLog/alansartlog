My name is Alan North and I’m an artist, mainly. I like to do all sorts of things, from diy to programming to writing, etc. I love learning you things and cramming my head with information.

The reason I started this blog is because I have several chronic health issues which make it hard to work or study, but having nothing to do was driving me crazy so I decided if/until I get better, it couldn't hurt to attempt to make a living doing the things I love.

If you would like to help support me, you can find out how [here](http://alansartlog.com/support-me) (I also take commissions, more info there as well).
