My name is Alan North and I’m an artist, mainly. I like to do all sorts of things, from diy to programming to writing, etc. I love learning you things and cramming my head with information. I don’t really like to talk about myself, but I feel if I don’t, some things that I mention wouldn’t make much sense. I was born in Argentina, but raised in the US. I moved back here when I was 17 to study computer science, but things didn't turn out as planned. My health issues got really bad and I've been stuck at home ever since. I can't work or study but having nothing to do was driving me crazy so I decided if/until I get better, it couldn't hurt to attempt to make a living doing the things I love. If you want to support me I'll take commissions ([contact me](http://alansartlog.com/contact)) on just about anything you see me do (sketches, paintings, etc). I also know how to bind books and basic web design (I built this website from scratch). And I've set up a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alansartlog) if you want to support me that way. Otherwise, the best way to support me is to share my work.
