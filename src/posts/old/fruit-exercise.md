I love doing exercises like this where it’s just about painting and getting the colors right (I did not use the included color picks) and I don’t really have to think about the drawing part. I find it very relaxing. You can download the file [here](https://cgcookie.com/exercise/exercise-39-sliced-fruit/) if you want to try it yourself.
