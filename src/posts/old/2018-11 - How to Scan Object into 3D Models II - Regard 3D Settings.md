This is a follow up to my previous [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaYfpGcXxmA)/[post](/2017/02/how-to-turnscan-objects-into-3d-models-with-just-a-camera)\* on how to scan object into 3d models with just a camera using Regard3d (a free Photogrammetry program).

In this video I go in depth into Regard 3Ds settings with visual comparisons and compare different scanning/lighting setups, to show you how you can get the cleanest scan possible.

\*It's not really necessary to have seen the previous video unless you get confused in the program about where to click or how to do something.

In fact, quite a few things didn't work for one reason or another in that video, anything I say here overrides whatever I said in that one, specifically the following:

- Using a Turntable - It is in fact the best and easiest way to scan things.
- Ink Stains - Seems like they might actually cause more problems sometimes.
- The Incremental Reconstruction Engine - It works for me now, and it so much better than the Global Reconstruction.
- The Texture Bug - If you did not know already, it has been fixed, so it's no longer a problem.

## Presentation

You can find the presentation below (or [direct link](https://alanscodelog.github.io/presentation-regard3d)). This is what I will keep updated.

### Updates 

I do not have the time at the moment to convert the presentation to a write up. So in case anything else pops up in the future, if anybody finds better settings or something, I will keep a list here, detailing changes/updates to the presentation.

## Test Picture Sets

You can find the test picture sets (all CC-BY licensed) along with other potentially useful links here: [Photogrammetry Test Sets](https://github.com/AlansCodeLog/photogrammetry-test-sets). 

If you use the picture sets for a video or blog post and/or find something interesting about the settings, I'd love to know, feel free to leave a comment or send me an email.

Additionally if you have any picture sets you're willing to contribute, mine are all hosted in individual repos in a gitlab group, so it's easy to add other's repos to it, see the Contributing section in the link above.

## Other News (3D Printer, Life, Perspective Videos)

### 3D Printer

As I talked about in the video, I'm saving up for a 3D printer. I don't want to promise anything because of my health\* but I would like to document the entire process of designing and building it.

My focus will be on having a very precise printer, that can print high temperature filaments as well (so it will be enclosed), that can also in the future maybe double as a cnc/laser (again, for the laser, it will need to be enclosed) and I will be experimenting with a DIY Remote Direct Drive. I haven't found anyone who's actually built one yet (the entire thing, not just the bit that attaches to the head), so I'm crossing my fingers the idea I have works.

**Also one of my focuses is to have as FEW 3D printed parts as possible.** At some point I will replace some of them maybe, cap the aluminum extrusions, etc, to pretty it up, but I want it to get to the functioning point with ideally 0 parts needing to be printed.

### \*Health/Life

My health has kept improving, so much so though that I started university again (although on a semi-remote basis), which is great but it eats into some of my time now. I'm nowhere near 100% though, I'd say I've gone from 1% to maybe 30%, but hopefully I will keep improving.

I'm studying to be a dental technician btw, and we learn all sorts of interesting things that could come in handy for DIY, so some of that stuff is sure to bleed into future projects.

### The New Perspective videos

I have not forgotten about them. I temporarily paused my work on them because of school and this video. They will happen... someday. My priorities now are the scan cleanup video and the 3D Printer.
