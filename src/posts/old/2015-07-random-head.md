I was fooling around with MyPaint and this just sort of happened. It might look pretty rough because I drew it very small. It’s more the size you see in the sketchbook thumb. The infinite canvas in MyPaint is really cool, but it also makes it hard to judge at what resolution you’re sketching so when you export drawings they might be bigger at 72-300 ppi than you were expecting.
