I’ve heard of artists keeping a notebook with just random color swatches as an exercise in observing color and I found that interesting. Also like I mentioned this is one of the things I most enjoy about painting, matching the colors. So I gave it a try.

I used quality printer paper which is quite fine for pencil sketches but it doesn’t take paint well so I’ll probably be making a tiny watercolor notebook just for this in the future because I really enjoyed it.
