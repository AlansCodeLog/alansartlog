The links were in the last post but I put them here again: [The first set of instructions I'd found on Will Kemp's blog in reply to him](http://willkempartschool.com/getting-started-how-to-choose-what-to-paint-on/) and [the ones I found later on Golden's site on a page about testing surfaces in general](http://oldsite.goldenpaints.com/justpaint/jp13article1.php).

Above is the scanned pieces of tape, right click > open image in new tab, to see them in full size.
