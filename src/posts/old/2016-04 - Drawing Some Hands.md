Okay it seems I won't be able to do daily drawings. It's too much work editing and uploading. By Friday I felt so horrible I was practically useless all day and that kind of reverberated through the weekend. I can draw daily, it's just the rest that kills me. So I'm thinking of like doing a weekly progress thing or every few days post whatever I've been working on like here.

This took 2-3 days and 3 hours total.
