The image is just the thumb. I'm not scanning 100 pages. I go through them all in the video.

For the references I used a mix of [pixelovely](http://artists.pixelovely.com/practice-tools/figure-drawing/), [quickposes](http://www.quickposes.com/gestures/timed), and [characterdesigns](http://www.characterdesigns.com/), hence why unfortunately I did not have very early poses that repeat later. I have saved a few of my favorite poses for next time so hopefully there will be more to compare.

The anatomy book I like to use is Classic Human Anatomy by Valerie L. Winslow. If you can only afford one book get this one. The only downside is it's all drawn but I have found no other book so well done.

As for Michael Hampton who I mentioned, he has a wonderful [blog](http://www.figuredrawing.info/) full of sketches that I found very helpful. He often shows his reference and I recommend you first attempt to do the pose from the reference, then look at his approach for help/comparison. He also has a book (Figure Drawing - Design and Invention) that looks very good.

The lightning bold figure drawing method I mentioned can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBq7rtnES0A).

Oh also, this is kind of unrelated, but I fixed the noise on my microphone! I'm using an iPhone with a mic app plugged into my computer and I thought the noise was just a side-effect of the cable or being so close to my fan, but turns out it was all Windows. I had microphone boost turned on because otherwise I couldn't use the computer mic before without it, turns out this just seems to introduce hideous amounts of noise.
