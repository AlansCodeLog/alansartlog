These are all the drawings I managed to do for inktober. You can see me flip through the sketchbook and talk a little about them in the video below. I also made a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZcWAAGgTGfovgtQWtlf0wwD_wcgA8hM1) with all the drawings I recorded. They're silent, but I added some details about the process for each in the description.

You can also go through all the drawings and any preparatory sketches I posted below.
