Their are way more limited palettes then what I covered. These are just the ones I wanted to try. Technically their are as many combinations of three colors as you could think of although only a couple dozen are very useful and common. You could even use a two color palette to great effect. James Gourney has some great examples of two palette paintings, [this one I think is one of the most striking](http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com.ar/2015/07/experiments-with-limited-palette.html). The Zorn palette is technically two color, but I see it more as a three color palette because the black serves as a substitute blue.

I also want to mention if you didn’t see the annotation I made, that it’s often much cheaper to buy a set if you can.

There’s also a lot of small sets to choose from, but for example with Golden, the small ones are around $0.16 per ml, while the big sets are only $0.11 per ml. Prices calculated from Amazon/Dick Blick.

There’s also different series/pigment prices to consider but the video was long enough. I’ll make a note to do a video on deciphering paint tubes.
