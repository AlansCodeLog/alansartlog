I never wanted to add unskippable ads.  Don't know exactly when this happened. Worst part is there's no option to batch remove the ads, so I had to go one by one to disable them. I think I got them all but if you find a video of mine with unskippable* ads please contact me so I can remove them. I only found out because I was turning off monetization for an outdated video and noticed it was on. I had seen lately that there had been a drop in views/revenues lately which I thought was a bit odd, but put it down to one of those random fluctuations, or maybe because I wasn't posting as frequently, but looking at my timeline now it's quite clear it was the unskippable ads. So, sorry for everyone who suffered through that. Hopefully in the future I can make enough of patreons and donations that I can disable them completely, but for now, unfortunately, I need the money to buy materials for projects, etc. *I believe \"unskippable\" ads below the 5 second skip timer don't count.

In this video I go in depth into Regard 3Ds settings with visual comparisons and compare different scanning/lighting setups, to show you how you can get the cleanest scan possible.  *It's not really necessary to have seen the previous video unless you get confused in the program about where to click or how to do something. In fact, quite a few things didn't work for one reason or another in that video, anything I say here overrides whatever I said in that one, specifically the following:  Using a Turntable - It is in fact the best and easiest way to scan things. Ink Stains - Seems like they might actually cause more problems sometimes. The Incremental Reconstruction Engine - It works for me now, and it so much better than the Global Reconstruction. The Texture Bug - If you did not know already, it has been fixed, so it's no longer a problem.  Presentation You can find the presentation below (or direct link). This is what I will keep updated.

Other News (3D Printer, Life, Perspective Videos)  3D Printer As I talked about in the video, I'm saving up for a 3D printer. I don't want to promise anything because of my health* but I would like to document the entire process of designing and building it. My focus will be on having a very precise printer, that can print high temperature filaments as well (so it will be enclosed), that can also in the future maybe double as a cnc/laser (again, for the laser, it will need to be enclosed) and I will be experimenting with a DIY Remote Direct Drive. I haven't found anyone who's actually built one yet (the entire thing, not just the bit that attaches to the head), so I'm crossing my fingers the idea I have works. Also one of my focuses is to have as FEW 3D printed parts as possible. At some point I will replace some of them maybe, cap the aluminum extrusions, etc, to pretty it up, but I want it to get to the functioning point with ideally 0 parts needing to be printed. *Health/Life My health has kept improving, so much so though that I started university again (although on a semi-remote basis), which is great but it eats into some of my time now. I'm nowhere near 100% though, I'd say I've gone from 1% to maybe 30%, but hopefully I will keep improving. I'm studying to be a dental technician btw, and we learn all sorts of interesting things that could come in handy for DIY, so some of that stuff is sure to bleed into future projects. The New Perspective videos I have not forgotten about them. I temporarily paused my work on them because of school and this video. They will happen… someday.

It sounded like it was on the verge of dying, so I didn't want to leave anything rendering on it. Initially I just planned to replace it but the only place that could get me the right model gave me a ridiculous quote (like $60) for what was probably a third party $5 chinese fan and I didn't want to go through the trouble of importing it myself. I thought, to hell with it, I'd rather save up and switch to a desktop, their parts are actually priced reasonably (by which I mean ~1.5 x US prices instead of 2-2.5 like nearly everything else, kill me) and it's easier to upgrade/repair. Also it's not like I move around as much as I used to when I bought the laptop. The only thing it really had going for it at this point was the battery because there's a lot of power outages where I live, but then battery started to die for the third time now, so even more reason to replace it. The only thing I'm sad about is that the 16GB RAM sticks I had ordered for it finally arrived (along with quite a few other art supplies and stuff I hope to be reviewing soon). I tested those for a while and I just cannot go back to just 8GBs anymore. Parts This is technically my first build. I have completely disassembled/reassembled laptops for cleaning/fixing, and I've changed parts on PCs, but never from scratch. I read up a bit before doing it, got stuck a few times with the cables, but all in all it was honestly the easiest part. If you've never built a PC there's plenty of videos showing you how to connect everything step by step, I won't even bother. I think it was harder to choose the parts and make sure they were all compatible and had what I needed more than anything else. There's websites like PC Parts Picker that can help you, but just because the parts are compatible doesn't mean that's they're best you can buy for the money or that all the parts are taking full advantage of each other. Motherboard and CPU A great example of that is the motherboard and the CPU. Sure you could get the cheapest motherboard that supports the cheapest CPU that meets your needs, but that probably wouldn't be the best idea. For example, Intel's 7400 i5 is about the same price here as AMD's Ryzen 1500X. Before Ryzen, AMD vs Intel was a no-brainer, but now, Ryzen chips are better for the price at nearly everything except gaming. But supposing they were the same, that specific i5 (the cheapest) is also locked, while the Ryzen isn't which means it can be overclocked. And there's the plus that AMD doesn't plan to change the AM4 socket for 4 years (Intel changes their's every 2 years). Here's where picking a motherboard can get tricky. Motherboards have three main compatibility criteria:  Form Factor - which just means the size (this only matters if you want a small case) Socket - which has to match the CPU Chipset - which is like the brain's of the motherboard and determines what the motherboard does/doesn't support in terms of overclocking, CrossFire/SLI (multiple graphics cards), and a few other things that usually aren't too important (e.g. max number of SATA and USB connections, RAID support, etc).  Ryzen Chipsets    Chipset A320 B350 X370     Overclocking No Yes Yes   Crossfire No Yes Yes   SLI No No Yes    As you can see to take advantage of the Ryzen 1500X and overclock it I needed to get at least the B350. The X370 is overkill for me because I won't be able to afford a 1070 (the minimum needed to SLI) anytime soon, let alone two, and looking at benchmarks a single 1080 still seems to do better than two 1070s. I didn't even bother comparing the Intel chipsets because the difference between just a locked/unlocked i5 was much greater than the difference between the A320 and the B350 motherboards for the Ryzen. After looking at several B350 motherboards I ended up going with a GA-AB350M-Gaming 3 because it was cheap and has a dual bios and bios flashes are always dangerous and I knew it was likely to need a few updates and I've had a motherboard die trying to upgrade the BIOS to support a new graphics card. It had some bad reviews, but most of them were complaining about problems with the BIOS and since it's fairly new that's to be expected. I updated and everything is working fine. It's best to do this manually through a USB btw instead of from within an OS through an app, check your motherboard for specific instructions.  I was able to overclock just fine. Also my RAM auto-overclocked itself to 2400MHz without having to enable X.M.P. or anything. More on that below. Overclocking the CPU I tried two different ways to overclock, through the BIOS and through AMD's Ryzen Master. I initially had the same problems with Ryzen Master. At one point it wouldn't reset to defaults, and even the defaults when applied felt a little bit different than the real defaults (after restart/uninstalling). So I went to the BIOS, disabled Core Performance Boost, Global C-State Controls, and Cool'n'Quiet as recommended and I got a stable (w/ 1 hour stress test) overclock at 3.8GHz @ 1.38V (+1.26 offset) with max temps of 67°C. I could get 3.9GHz but at 1.45V (+2.00 offset) with temps reaching 76°C, which I would not leave for long term use. Btw I used HWiNFO to get the voltage reading because it looked like the most accurate (and Ryzen would not read voltage when overclocked from the BIOS). I then went to enable Global C-State Controls and Cool'n'Quiet again (not Core Performance Boost!) to see if I could get the CPU to downclock when idle. It was stable but it wouldn't lower the frequency, just the voltage, not sure what that means? So I switched back to using Ryzen Master because it downclocks properly. The only problem with it is it doesn't apply the overclock on startup, you have to apply it manually, it's not too much of a bother, it's kind of nice I can only turn it on if I know I'll need it. RAM Like I mentioned after trying 16GB I could not got back to 8GB. Photoshop especially can handle much larger canvases than it used to and now I can run 3-4 large programs and 20 Chrome tabs at the same time and have yet to reach 100%, it's great. I got a single Kingston Fury DDR4 2400Mhz 16GB stick that \"auto-overclocked\" itself to 2400Mhz from the start (on the BIOS it came with, version F4). I say \"auto-overclocked\" because the advertized speed is already an overclock, it's like the speed it's been tested to be stable at, but some memories need to be manually enabled in the BIOS by enabling X.M.P. to run above 2133Mhz. It should be possible to overclock it further, but I have not tried it yet. Graphics Card I got a 1050 Ti with 4GBof VRAM and I got the best one I could find, a Zotac OC edition with dual fans. I was tempted to get a 1060 3GB but I only I had enough money to \"push\" one thing (RAM, CPU, or GPU) and I chose RAM because of the reasons I said and also because any graphics card would be an improvement over what I was using. I reasoned if I found it lacking, I would then save up for something a lot better (at least the 6GB 1060). In the video though I'm using an old 545 just because the graphics card hadn't arrived yet. I was going to sell it, but the 1050 Ti makes the screen freeze a bit when rendering because the Ryzen doesn't have built-in graphics, so I might just keep it to drive the display. Power Supply So the market here for power supplies is 90% cheap Senteys, then 18% were known brand names (Thermaltake, etc) but they were often overpriced for the quality of the PSU (look up Tier lists online). They were all Tier 4, which is better than an untiered unrated Sentey anyday, but it's usually recommended you get something better if you're overclocking. There were no Tier 1 PSUs available, but there a few (2%) Tier 2 PSUs: Seasonic's (S12II and M12II) but they were 520W (Bronze rated, non-modular) and 620W (Bronze, modular) respectively, and for a little bit less than the 620W one there was an XFX XTR 650W which was Gold rated and modular. Although the computer doesn't need anything near even 500W, I got the XFX because it was the best value for the price and basically future proof. Unlike the graphics card which is easy to sell, I imagine it's a bit harder to sell a used PSU. Also, now that I might use both graphic's card, I'm even more glad I got it. If you know nothing about Power Supplies, like I said, look at a Tier list and get the best you can afford. A basic White 80 Plus rating is a must, but that doesn't guarantee quality. The rating is just how power efficient the PSU is, though of course because you need better components to achieve better efficiency the higher ratings have some correlation with quality (if the PSU you find happens to not be tiered). Apart from quality though, it's good to get a high rating if you'll be leaving things to render overnight, etc. Case Much like with the PSU, 80% of the market is Sentey cases, with the rest being way overpriced because they tend to import the nicest brand name models. Unlike the PSU though there isn't as much of a problem going cheaper so long as you shop around, and I found this nice Sentey GS-6000 model that came with 4 fans (one of which is a huge 120mm side fan), a dust filter, an SD card reader, and 4 HDD bays for 3.5\" and 2.5\" drives. Ph and a fan controller, but I didn't use it. Now it had it's problems, the frontal HDD fan didn't work (but I had everything built by then and couldn't care to replace it), and the HDD bays were badly designed. They did not fit 2.5\" drives as advertised which is something I wanted because I have three 2.5\" drives. Well technically they did fit, you can screw them in, but they're so far in, you can't connect them to the power supply or the data cables. I had to drill holes along the edge of the bracket, add masking tape where the circuitry touched the metal, and secure the back with masking tape as well.  But I was kind of expecting something to go wrong so I don't regret it. In the end it worked just fine. The drives have been fine with my fix, and apart from the SSD (which didn't need any masking tape or anything because it's all plastic), I will probably replace the drives for 3.5\" drives in the future. I will replace that frontal fan someday when it needs cleaning, otherwise the other fans have worked great, they're nice and silent (compared to a cheaper Sentey case I've heard), there's good ventilation, and all the other buttons/connections/LEDs work. Monitor Lastly I want to take a moment to rant about monitors for a second. On my laptop I had a monitor that covered of the ~95% NTSC color gamut. The colors on it were great. As far as I know it's a TN panel and it's viewing angles are superb. I love it. Now there aren't any affordable monitors here with a similar color gamut, so it was either a cheap TN or a cheap IPS, so I thought ok, I'll get an IPS, I heard they were great. Well I honestly don't understand how people can say that (well I can see it compared to a cheap TN panel, but not a good one). I got an LG 24MP48HQ-P and at first I didn't notice the IPS glow. Something seemed off about the colors, the black and grays seemed off, I thought it was just a transition from a good monitor to an ok one, I kept fiddling with the settings and couldn't make it look right. Then I put it next to my monitor and I noticed the viewing angles were just awful. All the viewing angles were way worse because of the IPS glow. Even compared to other TN monitors around the house, even compared to the old Dell one I ended up using which has the worst viewing angles. Once I saw the glow I could not unsee the glow. Now I do sit very close (~40cm) because that's what I'm used to and also I'm having some eye problems and that's the farthest I can see with my glasses, but the monitor needed at least a meter for the glow to go away which is a ridiculous distance and this was WITH ambient light. I don't know if higher quality monitors (like a Dell Ultrasharp) are better, but I still find reports about IPS glow for even expensive monitors, so I don't want to buy anything else without seeing it and here it's very rare for monitors to be on display for some reason and there are NO return policies. I have seen a few TN monitors on display but they were clearly bad quality. I'm stuck now trying to resell this thing and don't want to be stuck with another. There are a few AMVA panel monitors, but I can't find much info on how the blacks compare to a good TN panel, only how they're better than IPS, but how much better? If anybody knows I'd love to hear. It's either that or I'm considering getting the more expensive 144Hz TN monitors used for gaming because on reviews they seem to have decent viewing angles like my laptop's monitor.  Also anybody know why some TN monitors can achieve better viewing angles? I remember I used to own one of those convertible tablet PCs and the TN screen had horrible viewing angles, it was only 12\" but if you didn't look at it dead on, the colors distorted A LOT. So when I was shopping for my laptop I made sure to get a screen that had good viewing angles and it did.","tags":["recording/editing tools","tools/software","reviews","random"],"permalink":"/2017/10/first-computer-build"},"/2017/07/how-to-export-models-from-regard3d-with-textures":{"title":"How to Export Models from Regard3D with Textures","contents":"EDIT: This post is outdated. The bug has been fixed.  If you saw my previous post/video about scanning objects into 3d models you'll know the current version of the program I used, Regard3D, has a bug with exporting objects with image textures. The developer is aware of it and it should get fixed eventually, but in the meantime, a viewer sent me an email with a better workaround so I thought I'd go over it. In the video I mentioned one way to get around it, and that is to use colored vertices, but as was pointed out to me, this creates much fuzzier textures at equal resolutions whereas an image texture will retain it's detail no matter the resolution of the model. I personally did not care about them so I didn't really investigate further, but the solution is embarrassingly simple if I would have thought about it more than two seconds. We know the program saves everything as it creates it to the project directory and it can correctly make and read textured models from there so the files in the project folder must be fine, the bug occurs only when a model is exported. Steps So what we can do is once we created our surface model with image textures (Colorization Type should say Textures), instead of exporting it, note down it's path in our project tree. For the picture set, just count which it is from 0.    Then open up the project folder in your computer and navigate to the path (e.g. Project Folder &gt; pictureset_1 &gt; matching_0 &gt; triangulation_0 &gt; densification_1 &gt; surface_0). Once there you'll see a bunch of files. We need the obj file (our model), the mtl or material library file (tells programs where to look for the textures), and the texture images. Copy them manually wherever you wanted to export them to.    Now we can import these into Blender (make sure your import extension for obj files is on) and they should work import automatically. If the textures aren't showing up just make sure you're using the Blender render engine and that you're in the texture view. This is how Blender imports them by default. To use them with a different rendering engine you'll have to connect the textures manually. Pros &amp; Cons    Colored Vertices Image Textures     Fuzzy Textures Detailed Textures   Smaller File Size at Same Detail Much Larger but…   Looks Much Worse at Low Resolutions* Same Texture Detail at Low Resolutions*   Computes Faster (2x +) Computes Slower (but again ^)   Duller/Less Reflective Captures more lighting artifacts.**    *This is because with colored vertices the amount of detail is tied to the amount of points, whereas with image textures, the texture is always the same resolution so it preserves it's details no matter the mesh's resolution. This is why in the image below, even though we're at the same mesh resolution, the colored vertices make the texture look fuzzy.    **By less reflective I mean that you don't get a lot of weird really light areas, especially if you had uneven lighting or scanned the model by turning it instead of turning the camera around the model. This causes lighting artifacts which are more noticeable when using image textures. I'm not 100% sure why that is, but it means using colored vertices might still be the better option if you don't care about the textures of your objects, just the color, and you want the scan to process faster. For example, if you were scanning a smooth multi-colored toy, you'd need to add texture to it somehow like I did with this model by spraying it with ink. So you'd have to paint the model by hand anyways if you wanted textures, so you'd only really need a rough reference of the object's colors, image textures would be overkill. Anyways, here are some more examples for comparison.  And here are some closeups, you can see how much detail the second one appears to hold even though the mesh is quite simple. If you have a keen eye you'll notice the textures aren't 100% the same, that's just because the program pieces them together slightly different at the different resolutions, but you can see the amount of detail is the same. Depth 8 w/ Colored VerticesDepth 6 w/ Colored VerticesDepth 8 w/ Texture ImagesDepth 6 w/ Texture Images Other Notes For those who might be wondering if it's possible to salvage the exported raw file, I did think it might be a simple bug, maybe an extra line or symbol or something that could be corrected by just editing the raw file, but the file is missing a lot of coordinates. Still I can open it in Meshlab and all the points are there, so if for some reason you lost all the files by this one, you could use the points to do the poisson surface reconstruction from there, though of course, you wouldn't be able to salvage the textures.","tags":["3d","3d model","photogrammetry","regard3d","tools/software","tutorials","videos"],"permalink":"/2017/07/how-to-export-models-from-regard3d-with-textures"},"/2017/03/teapot-quick-oil-study":{"title":"Teapot - Quick Oil Study","contents":"","tags":["artwork","oils","studies","videos"],"permalink":"/2017/03/teapot-quick-oil-study"},"/2017/03/beach-quick-color-study":{"title":"Beach - Quick Color Study","contents":" Here's the initial thumb sized study: ","tags":["artwork","acrylics","studies","videos"],"permalink":"/2017/03/beach-quick-color-study"},"/2017/02/how-to-turnscan-objects-into-3d-models-with-just-a-camera":{"title":"How to Turn/Scan Objects Into 3D Models With Just a Camera","contents":" In this video I'll be showing you how you can turn almost any object into a 3D model with just your camera and some free software. Now I'm not an expert at any of this. I've tried as best as possible to read through all the documentation, at least the parts I understand, and condense that into a video. Also please note the cleanup process was aimed at getting it ready for sculpting. I know that people like to scan objects to then 3d print them, but I don't have a 3d printer, so you'll have to look somewhere else for the details on how to do that properly. Lastly, I would love to share the project file so you can see what I tested but it's HUGE (15GB) and I'm not sharing the 3d model just yet because it's an original character of mine so I'm working on a generic version for practicing lighting the face, the first version is now available for patreons. Intro So there are free programs out there like Autodesk 123D Catch (which was a bit limited when I checked it out) and there are some open source programs like VisualSFM but I wanted something that was both open source, and therefore free (w/ no patent issues) AND allowed for commercial use, and the only program that seemed to satisfy that requirement was Regard3D. Also it's the only one of the open source programs that takes you from the photos to the finished model. Otherwise you might have needed 2-3 different programs as this blog post illustrates. Regard 3D Pros:  Open source All-In-One Solution Advanced options. (but also works well out of the box) Simple Nice UI. Branching (saves past parameters) File \"Autosaves\" Crashes only loose what was computing. Allows Exporting (of sparse and dense point clouds as well as models)  Cons:  Texture bug (solution). Has been fixed.  Resource intensive, but then most photogrammetry programs are.  The Pictures The ideal way would be to have the camera rotate around the object with plenty of soft lights. Alas, I could not do that, so my setup was more like two desk lamps which I diffused as much as possible with a piece of paper and a blank white background. I then rotated the object instead of the camera.  The moving highlights and shadows can cause some problems, but I was able to get a decent scan this way anyways. Unless your object is made of glass (in which case you'll have to coat it in something so it's matte), and not too glossy it should work. Texture Even if the surface is matte though you need some texture else you won't get any matches. For this you can splatter some ink, or watercolors, or something (test the pigment will not stain first). This will help a lot if your object is a sculpt like mine with minimal texture. Without it the software has no good reference as to where anything is in space. How many pictures to take? More is always better, but there is also a point where this will just slow down your computer. I recommend 4 different height angles and about ~16 photos each round. In total I took about 74 photos for this not including the extras. Also if possible your photos should all be with the same camera at the same focal length. Regard 3D Adding Images First create a project: File &gt; New Project. Select where it's going to store the files (it can take up many GBs, mine was ~15GBs by the end of this with so many tries) and the name. In the lower left you'll see a button that says Add Picture Set...  Here you can add all your image files. It might take a few seconds for them to load all the metadata. Make sure the camera model, focal length, and sensor size are set. If the sensor size is not set in the newest version you can now set it manually (right click) if the program could not find your camera model in it's database. Just google for your camera model and sensor size. If the focal length isn't set you can also set it manually but you'll have to know what focal length you used. Then just name your picture set something and add all the images. NOTE: Do not move the images after you've added them or you will get an error trying to open the project. This can be fixed by opening the .r3d file in the project folder with notepad or some other text editor and finding and replacing the incorrect paths, but be warned. Computing Matches Now the Regard3D documentation, link below, goes more in depth into some of the options. I'm not going to go over everything, just cover some of the stuff it doesn't cover or what I learned worked best for me from experience. Here the default settings work pretty well. I found on my laptop (specs at the end) setting keypoint sensitivity too high would cause it to crash (EDIT: this no longer happens on my new better desktop). Setting the keypoint matching ratio to high though and the keypoint sensitivity to low improved some of my results without crashing.  This can take a while, up to an hour for me at least (EDIT: Takes me 5-15 min on my new computer!). Tree Structure So at this point you'll notice the tree view in the sidebar has started branching out. Here's what a finished project looks like for example:  At any point you can go back and check the parameters you used, how much time it took, etc, and each level will give you different options depending on what stage you're on. You can also export point clouds and models to other programs from here if that stage allows for it. Are there enough matches? If you click on your matches you should now see several options in the lower left:  If you click Show matching results... you'll get a dialog showing you the matches. At first you won't see anything different. Check Show Keypoints to actually show the matches. Even then you might not quite see them. So to zoom in you can Open Preview Window and you should now be able to see a bunch of little circles around the ink splatters. To see matches between pairs, in the lower half click Show Matches. It might take a second to load. And if you took your pictures right you should see just a bunch of lines, to the point you can't even see the images well.  Triangulation Next you're going to want to triangulate these matches. Basically in photogrammetry there's two point clouds you need to create, a sparse and a dense point cloud. This will create the first. Click Triangulation. There's two options here, Incremental Structure from Motion and Global Structure from Motion.   I could not get the first to work, it just crashes (EDIT: This no longer happens to me on my new computer and it works better sometimes). So I use Global.  As to the other options, some match a few more cameras than others, but they didn't make much of a difference. This shouldn't take that long to compute, just a few minutes. Finally you'll be able to see some points on the screen. If you load some other model and want to get back to this you can always just Show Triangulated Points.   You can also make the points bigger by moving the Point size slider in the top right. You should now be able to see a bunch of little green dots. Those are the cameras it captured. And in the lower left there's a field that tells you how many cameras were captured out of the total. Usually ~80/90% or more is enough. Densification From your triangulation click Create dense pointcloud....  Here you basically have two options CMVS/PMVS and MVE.   CMVS/PMVS Use visibility information : Uncheck this if you don't have that many images (~70 is not many) can produce better results because it will use more cameras. Levels : This is like the resolution. With a lower number being a higher resolution. Threshold : Increasing this can help reduce artifacts. Cell size : Related to the resolution, works similar to Level. Min. image num: If a point only appeared in 2 images but this is set to 3 it won't use it, so I suggest lowering this to 2 for the amount of photos I recommended. Now I prefer MVE because I could not get Level 1 to work for me, only Level 2 and it looks worse than the defaults for MVE which do work for me. This one does take a lot less time though (couple of minutes). And it seems to produce nicer point clouds with less artifacts but the end model did not look as nice as with MVE. BUT you loose the option later to do a Floating Surface Reconstruction. MVE Scale: The resolution with a lower number being a higher resolution. The problem with MVE is that anything but the defaults seems to create a lot of weird artifacts and nothing but the defaults seemed to work. It also takes a lot longer (2-3h) Edit: On my new computer it's now 10-30min. If your computer isn't very powerful you might get out of memory errors. Try closing all your programs and just leaving it to run for a while or overnight, sometimes it will recover and finish. But it does allow you do do Floating Surface Reconstructions later. The Dense Point Cloud The view might lag quite a bit at this point. You should see something that looks like your object with a few artifacts close to the surface depending on what method you chose. As long as there isn't a large cloud of them, you can still get good results.  For my case MVE at defaults turned out the better result. Creating the Surface Click Create Surface. We get the two options, one I already mentioned…   Floating Surface Reconstruction Levels: Like the resolution except now a higher value = more resolution. This one can take ~1h sometimes for Level 0 which is the lowest so I was not able to try it out much and am not 100% confident as to what some of the other parameters do. I do know though that if you get blobs floating around the model, turning Confidence Threshold and Minimum Component Size up a bit will help get rid of those artifacts. Possion Surface Reconstruction PS: Sorry for the mispronunciation in the video, I literally read this as Poison. This is my preferred method. Depth: Like the resolution except now a higher value = more resolution. Don't go too high (9-10) or you'll get a lot of artifacts. Samples per Node: Turning this up helps get rid of artifacts. As for the other two settings, the defaults work well, turning them up just seems to make the base a bit neater. Colorization As part of the surface reconstruction textures are created. There used to be a bug with the Textures option, the newest version has fixed it. Textures are more detailed since it will produce image textures, while Colored Vertices depends on the resolution of the mesh but it also a bit faster. Now the bug is fixed I do not recommend Colored Vertices unless you don't care about the textures at all. unfortunately you can't preview the surface without the textures if you used Colored Vertices so it kind of negates that instance too. If you use Textures you can toggle them off in the sidebar to the right. Exporting From here we'll need to export our model for cleanup in other programs. You can use either Meshlab, it's free  (you can also do the surface reconstruction of point clouds from there) but it's very hard to understand and the newest version does not work for me, or Blender. I could not record the cleanup because the mesh was so huge and freezing my computer, but at the end of the video I try to illustrate the basic steps I took with a simple sphere. LINKS Regard3D + Tutorial/Documentation Meshlab&nbsp;(I was using 1.3.4BETA) Blender If your object is particularly small I recommend you look at this part of the tutorial I wrote on magic lantern (you don't need it to apply the concepts described but it's helpful if you have an DSLR camera). PS: To give you an idea of the type how long it might take on your computer, or what type of computer you need, I'm using a laptop with an Intel i5, 8GB of RAM, and a NVIDIA 650M GPU. Edit: And my new computer is a desktop with a Ryzen 1500x, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and an NVIDIA 1050Ti so you can see why it no longer struggles.","tags":["3d","3d model","sculpting","tools/software","tutorials","videos"],"permalink":"/2017/02/how-to-turnscan-objects-into-3d-models-with-just-a-camera"},"/2016/12/polymer-clay-basics-part-iii":{"title":"Polymer Clay Basics Part III","contents":" This is the third and last part of the polymer clay basics tutorial.

Armatures My first tip is to use a sturdy bulked out armature that's a attached or can be easily attached to some sort of base. You do not want to try sculpting anything complex without an armature because you'll never find a place to grip it without ruining a different part.  For a figure you can run the main wires through the base of a piece of wood like this.&nbsp; And on the top and bottom I used a special 2 part epoxy clay to secure it, more on that in a bit.   For smaller parts you have to find a way to clamp them to something steady. There are proper stands and clamps you can get specifically for sculpting, and there are many ways to make your own, just keep in mind the type and size of sculpts you'll be making. For example, the stand I'm using I bought for soldering and really tiny sculptures, so it didn't work well at all for the larger head I made. So I'm looking into making something to replace it that's also easy to film. The clamp setup above, although it worked really well, was not easy to film because I move it around so much. You can see this in some parts of my head sculpt time-lapse.  Now if possible, use a base you can just pop into the oven. Here I used some water based clay to make a base. But wood also works fine. It won't burn or anything because the temperature you're baking it at is too low and you can grab it without getting burnt when taking it out of the oven (which is not true for metal or even any of the clays I've tried). Otherwise if you don't have a stand, you'll have to lay the piece down and that part will get burnt and slightly flattened. It can be cut away but it's still something to consider.  I also want to mention that you should protect your work surface with something, at least a sheet of paper if you're working with bases because otherwise you'll get scratches all over your desk from moving it around.&nbsp; Using a turntable might also be useful and is something I'm looking into. In summary consider the following when choosing a stand:  Size of the sculpts you'll be making. Whether it's a part like a head or it's a full figure. It can be in the oven. …and preferably has some place to grip it that won't burn you when it's hot. Easily handled and rotated&nbsp;(turntable) without having to grip the actual sculpt. This one is more for me, but if you want to film your sculpts, that's also something to consider.  As for the actual wire to build the armatures, I got these two rolls and never needed anything else.  These are galvanized steel, but anything that doesn't rust will probably work, and I'd recommend having something around 16 gauge for medium sized pieces like this one, and 28 gauge for miniatures, or for if you need to add extra support in thin areas, or to attach things like these fingers.  Bulking out Armatures Apart from an armature you also need to bulk your figure out, not just to waste less clay, but to reduce it's weight and make it easier to work on. A lot of people use aluminium. I personally can't stand it. I gave it one last chance, wrapped it in wire over a groove in the wood. It still moved and wobbled. And it's always lumpy. When you try to smooth it while sculpting if you mess with it too much, it starts to shed little pieces. I hate it. Instead I like to work over something solid. For this sculpture that I never finished, I used a two part epoxy clay called Fixit-Sculpt. It feels similar to polymer clay just slightly stickier. It has a working time of 3-4 hours and cures within a day and you can do stuff like add little wires for the fingers like I showed. You can even just use this instead of polymer clay. But it's more expensive. I've heard of people using cheaper plumber's epoxy clays, but I've never tried them and from what I understand those are meant to cure quickly so you don't get a lot of working time (but that might be an advantage to some?). Now I just use an air-drying water based clay called cold porcelain. It's really cheap, light, and dries rock hard. I'm not sure how available it is outside my country, but you can easily make your own (it's mostly glue and cornstarch). There are different types of water based clay, just be sure they're tough when dry, they can survive being put in the oven, and they've properly dried before using them because they tend to shrink and loose detail which is why you can't really use them for detailed stuff on their own. The ideal material in my mind would be:  Inexpensive Strong Light Flexible (just a bit) Easy to Smooth Can be in the oven (and is preferably not affected by heat). Can be easily carved.  For my head sculpt though, it was very humid those days and the cold porcelain was taking too long to dry so I used sculpey and baked it, which is a bit wasteful, but it is one alternative. Like I mentioned before, it's perfectly fine to work in layers using the normal cooking directions. I still have no idea how people can work all at once. I baked this head when I did the initial sphere, when I finished the facial features, after each ear, after the neck, and then the final bake, for now, was the hair. Baking in layers also helps if you've got uneven thicknesses in a figure. This might be because my oven takes forever to heat up, but ears and hair strands, for example, are likely to change color if I cook a piece all at once because they're cooked for a longer time than in layers. I did get a little bit of color shift on the nose but it was in a very early layer, and it's still less than what would have happened had I baked it all at once. I've also heard layers help avoid cracking with thick areas, but I've not had problems with cracks myself. Also even if you can work in one layer, I've found that if you only sculpt every now and then and take a long time, the clay will start to harden and become brittle like it does in storage. It's not immediately noticeable sometimes. This clay has been on this armature for over a year now and you can still push it without any noticeable effects. But here's a bit from the same batch of clay I softened for that figure. Again you can push it around, but look what happens as I push at increasingly fragile areas.  It's really dry. I've never cooked it when this has happened, but I can't imagine this being good. If you plan on leaving a project for more than I month, if it doesn't look good or you were just starting to block out things like here I'd take it off, otherwise if it looks decent, I'd bake it. I've always had problems with my clay hardening quickly but I've heard some people don't so you can also save a piece like I did from that batch you mixed for the sculpt to test for flexibility later. Edit: Also be sure to cover your sculpt any time you put it away with a plastic bag to keep it from getting dusty. Now if you find you baked it and you made a mistake you can also carve away at baked clay if you need to redo a part. If money wasn't a problem, I'd probably only use epoxy or polymer clay for everything because they're the easiest to carve away at (with polymer clay being slight easier than epoxy, but also less strong and with a rough texture where you cut it). The cold porcelain clay is a lot harder in comparison so I try to make sure it's the right size and as even as possible when using it to bulk out. Reference Now whatever you want to sculpt, even as you're bulking out an armature, always try to use reference . Also if possible get or draw a side and front view and print it out at the size you're sculpting if you can.  This will help you bulk out to the right size, and keep your sculpture proportioned. Alternatively you can use your computer screen, just note the zoom level you're viewing the image at.  Apart from photo reference, it can also be useful to do some brainstorming sketches, especially if you only have a vague idea of what you want to do. Here are some sketches I made to test how I might do the planes of the face. It might be hard to make them accurate, but they can still be helpful. I've narrowed down for example that I want something simple and that the mouth gives me the most trouble. I will get into measuring and symmetry in the third part.","tags":["art supplies","sculpting","tools/software","tutorials","videos"],"permalink":"/2016/12/polymer-clay-basics-part-ii"},"/2016/12/polymer-clay-softening-experiments":{"title":"Polymer Clay Softening Experiments","contents":"This is an extension of&nbsp;Polymer Clay Basics - Part I. First &amp; Second Test I initially did a&nbsp;few rough experiments myself though with different substances. I only thought of a few things I had on hand (not baby oil), then I redid part of the test with the baby oil but I didn't bake it exactly the same (the first test you see in the pictures was slightly overcooked). So it was a bit of a mess but it told me that in a pinch you could use just about anything. At normal cooking temperatures there was very little difference in coloration. There were some differences in flexibility but Fimo is so flexible no piece broke from the bending.   The results as best as I could present them are below.  Third Test I was unsatisfied with these so I redid them, adding every chemical I could think of, even inpractical ones. Unfortantely although my methodology was much more consistent (5mm thick x 10cm long strips curved into a loop&nbsp;and small 1mm flattened strips), Super Sculpey is so fragile the strength tests I feel are a bit inconclusive. From left to right. First of all None was kneaded as much as possible without adding anything to soften it, I didn't just cook an old fragile chunk, it would have been impossible (it just crumbles). Visible cracks means any visible cracks in the loops I made after baking them, though they were formed when bending the raw clay. Force Required to Break means I got the loops of clay and pressed them against the scale by hand (I couldn't think of a more accurate way to do this) then noted the approximate point at which they broke and repeated again just in case it was a weak crack that caused it. But that's still too few sample I think to really know. With flexibility, like I said, none of them flexed. I was hoping one of the substances would give the fragile Super Sculpey a bit more flexibility but none did. There is no discoloration at regular cooking time and temperatures, but I will be forcing them to discolor by overcooking and updating the chart when that's done.  Conclusion All in all I'm a bit disappointed and will be continuing tests when I can afford it. I will probably use Fimo or a mix of Fimo and Super Sculpey, maybe also testing just how much detail each can hold in comparison. Even though as I have shown, any flexibility any substance might add won't be noticeable with Super Sculpey, Fimo is more flexible and&nbsp;will allow me to more accurately measure any differences.","tags":["art supplies","sculpting","tools/software"],"permalink":"/2016/12/polymer-clay-softening-experiments"},"/2016/12/polymer-clay-basics-part-i":{"title":"Polymer Clay Basics - Part I","contents":" So since I read the Imaginative Realism book that I reviewed I started on a head sculpt to have as reference. I had been working on a 3d model of a head before that, but it's not done yet. I thought I'd take the chance to get back into sculpting, plus it's faster than 3d modeling for me still and it's always nice to have something physical. I don't have a 3d printer, so I can't print any 3d models I make, but it's possible to turn a sculpt like this into a 3d model with just a camera and the right software.   I'm still figuring this out. There are apps like Catch123D by Autodesk that can scan objects, but I'm not sure if you can export them or what you're allowed to do with the model. So I've been looking into opensource software but it's quite complicated. There's also problems I think with the object being solid gray which is why you&nbsp;can only really make out defined areas like the eyes, nose, lips, and some of the hair. When I figure it out I'll try to do a step-by-step tutorial. For now I just want to do this sort of quick intro in polymer clay. In this part I'm going to cover the different types, how to soften it, and how to bake it. The second part will cover armatures, the different ways to bulk them out, and the importance of reference. Finally in the last part I'll cover the different tools I use, how to blend clay, and a real time demonstration of some of the techniques I use. I have these mostly edited, it's just my internet does not handle uploads over 10-15 minutes well, they fail a lot. Also I'm going to be busy so I thought I'd just split them. Polymer Clay Types First of all regular polymer clay comes in all sorts of colors. I'm honestly not very familiar with these, they're better suited to things that don't require a lot of detail. If you want more info the glass attic polymer clay encyclopedia has a lot&nbsp;of in-depth information (glass attic: clay types). I'm more familiar with Super Sculpey which is what most professional sculptors use. The regular Super Sculpey comes in this skin like semi-translucent beige, but I've found it's slight translucency makes it hard to see and it tends to darken a lot when baked. Instead I would recommend a gray clay, it's much easier to see details and it also bakes to a much more consistent color that is easy to photograph. At the time when I bought my clay only Super Sculpey Firm came in gray and I ended up combining my block of Super Sculpey with a block of Super Sculpey Firm to get more of the workability of regular one and the gray color of Firm. Now they actually sell this mix premade as Super Sculpey Medium. I've also accidentally bought glow in the dark Fimo clay once instead of white (they say \"effect\" on the package and the effect is in really tiny print in the corner). The white is easier than the semi-translucent beige to work with, but I still prefer gray. And yes the glow in the dark does work. I mixed it into some of the gray clay, and now my head sculpt glows a bit as well.  Hopefully you can see the glow in the dark, it's hard to capture. As you might have gathered polymer clay comes in different firmnesses, with the regular multi-colored clays usually being softer and the more professional ones being harder because the firmness determines how well the clay holds details. The harder the clay the more detail, but they also get dry and brittle faster in storage.  My five year old chunk of mixed sculpey has been in storage for a while (I think at least&nbsp;a year, possibly two) and it's hard as a rock. The good thing though is that you can soften it back up again so long as you never left it somewhere hot because that would bake it. To do so you can buy a softener that they sell or you can use baby oil (or mineral oil). And I double checked this with Sculpey because I had my doubts, but they said that it was the best alternative if you can't find the softener.    Hello.   Thank you for contacting Polyform.   Yes, we recognize that the Sculpey Liquid Clay Softener may not be available in all areas and therefore you can you a few drops of white mineral oil (baby oil) to help soften the clay.   It is always best to use the Sculpey Liquid Clay Softener as this has the same plasticizer as the clay itself, but the baby oil will work.   Alcohol and water do not work as softeners for the clay and will have negative effects on the clay and can cause cracking/bubbles or surface imperfections.  I want to clarify that alcohol should be perfectly fine for using at the end to smooth your sculpt as I will go into detail in the third part, but as they replied above and as I noted in my experiments, it should not be used for mixing with the clay and&nbsp;gives it a really bizzare texture. Experiments I have moved these to their own post because it got a bit long. Somebody also did strength tests on just clays if that's something that's important for your sculpture. Back to Softening To start you need to cut your clay into small bits. Mine was already crumbled a bit in the bag. Some put the big chunks in a bag and hammer them. I cut up all the large chunks by hand with an x-acto knife. Next for actually mixing and handling the clay on, having a piece of glass is nice. Usually I just use my glass palette and wash it properly afterwords. To soften it by hand it's best to chop the clay even smaller, then mix in small batches. Don't mix some, then try to add dry bits to it. It's much harder to then mix those properly. Mix small amounts then put those together. Now softening it with your hands will hurt, so if you can get a pasta machine that you can pass it through that will help a lot. Sculpey sells one and it's nice that it's stainless steel so it won't rust, but a regular pasta machine will do as well. Now I've heard conflicting info about polymer clay safety, supposedly it's pretty safe, but I would not use the pasta machine or any other kitchen tools for food again without a very thorough cleaning. And again be careful if your pasta machine isn't stainless steel, it will rust if it doesn't dry properly. Chrome plated steel rusted on third use from pasta stuck where you can't clean it.Removed the rollers for other pasta types and the top plates of the regular roller. Left the bottom plates (you can't see them) that force the clay/pasta not to stick to the rollers. After being in storage for a while this one had rusted from bits of pasta that were stuck inside. I cleaned it, put it back together, but this time I removed the top plates so that it's easier to clean. For actually mixing with the pasta machine I tend to use the thinnest setting and it's best to start out with a small bit that you mixed by hand, because otherwise the dry bits tend to fly everywhere if you just try to pass them through. Flatten that small bit, then lay it across the rollers and add some dry chunks and a bit of softener, then kneed that until it's soft and has no lumps. Repeat until you have enough clay. To make sure it's properly mixed, especially when doing it by hand, it can be useful to mix in a bit of a different colored clay if you have some, so then you can tell when it's thoroughly mixed. Now I would suggest you mix only a bit more than the clay you're going to use and for storage I recommend you cut it into long strips or little chunks so it's easier to remove later. I've heard putting it into an airtight container helps prevent it from drying. I'd never really tried it before, I'd always used ziplock bags and they never worked, so I'll be trying putting them in an airtight container and I'll report back in a few months on the results. Lastly be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after working with the clay. Baking I'll stick to baking it normally in the oven, but I just want to mention that there's many different ways to bake polimer clay. Some people boil it, some use a heat gun, some slowly cook it until it's overcooked and hard as a rock [overcooking =/= burning], some vary the temperatures in a subset of overcooking called ramp baking. It all depends on what you have and your needs. So feel free to experiment so long as you don't burn it.  Now I had always been under the impression until recently that you shouldn't cook it in the oven where you cook food, so I have always used these cooking bags used to cook chickens. I put my pieces in there, squeeze some of the air out because if you don't and a piece shifts it's hard to grab it, then twist the bag and clip it closed.  Once it's done cooking, I take it outside, take the clip off, careful it'll be hot, and take the sculpture out of the bag if I can, you don't have to. Just try not to breathe the fumes, then leave everything there to cool. Supposedly though it's safe to cook it without the bag, but it really smells quite awful. This is much easier than having to ventilate the whole room, especially if you cook a lot. The bag can just be re-used over and over again. The recommended temperature is 130 degrees Celsius for Sculpey, some other types might say 110 C but it's okay to mix them and bake at 130. The real danger point is 175C where it will burn and release hydrochloride&nbsp;gas. That's quite a large safety margin but if you want to cook your pieces consistently, note that ovens are rarely calibrated right. Get an oven thermometer if you can, or you can cook it at a lower temperature for longer than suggested. Some ovens, like mine, might not even have such low temperatures. I suspect mine is actually cooler than it says, but if yours is warmer you can leaving the door open a bit or warming up the oven first, then turning it off to actually bake the clay.  And yes you can recook it and work in layers, more on that in the second part. This is it for this part. I hope you found it helpful.

I have tried to cut out the parts where the head wasn't in frame. The camera also ran out of battery several times so I've lost bits here and there. And then there's parts of the head I redid a couple times which I didn't include because I had about 15 hours of footage in total and even that as a time-lapse would have made a huge video and I didn't want to speed it up more than it was.&nbsp; This is at 1FPS btw. Now I calculate the head actually took me about 20 hours but I think with some more practice I can cut that time by more than half. I'm just a bit rusty. It's been a few years since I've done any sculpting and even then I was only really interested in small figures before. I've never attempted a head this big. Things that worked well on a small scale like shaping the hair as one solid mass did not translate well to this scale. Also the stand I'm using wasn't designed for something so big. I'd specifically bought it for it's magnifying glass to do details. I'm currently looking into ways to make my own stand. This isn't such a problem for a full body figure because you can just thread it's feet through a piece of wood. I have one ready which I never finished which I'll probably get back to one of these days. But with a head like this it's a bit different. I want to move it around, but that just makes you dizzy when you're watching the time-lapse so I have to figure out how to fix that. The good thing though is I'll probably redo this sculpt at some point in the future because it has a few mistakes, and hopefully by then I'll have a proper stand. For now though it's good enough for what I want to do with it which is mostly just use it to practice different lighting situations. I was going to make just the planes of the face but I couldn't help myself. The face is based off a character I have in mind for my book. So I might also use it to try and finish his portrait which I've been attempting for ages. If possible I want to have at least two more heads for reference. One with just the planes, and then a detailed female head. I have tried to use 3d models in the past but there's always something about the free 3d models available that feel off to me. I am currently working on my own, but it's still in the works, I keep having problems with the head looking off when I zoom out because I sculpt so close (because the focal length of the view is wrong for being so close to an object). I also have a hard time making the lighting look natural, so I'm still learning that. After reading the Imaginative Realism book I thought I'd go ahead and try making a physical sculpt and although it took a while, it was way less time than what I've worked on the 3d model. The other advantage compared to a 3d model is that I can have the physical model and then I can also scan it and turn it into a 3d model. It&nbsp;(photogrammetry) is something I've looked into before but never really attempted so I'll be trying that. All you need is a bunch of photos of the objects and the proper software so it should be something anybody can do. The problem is figuring out the software. So then hopefully I can also use the scan to figure out at what the camera focal length should actually be when I'm sculpting so I can finish the 3d model as well. Anyways if you have any questions about polymer clay, I want to do a sort of intro video on the basics, so leave a comment and I'll see about including them in that video. Otherwise I hope you enjoy the video despite it's problems. Here are the pictures as well if you want to see them more in detail. Imgur Embed ","tags":["artwork","sculpting","videos"],"permalink":"/2016/11/head-sculpt-timelapse"},"/2016/11/tripod-quick-tip":{"title":"Quick Tip - How to Tighten Tripod Legs","contents":" I didn't finish the video I really wanted to do (on sculpting with polymer clay) so this is just a quick tip. It won't work for all tripods, but it should work for most of the ones that use hinges to tighten the legs.  This is my tripod and these plastic hinges have become lose over time and the way I have this hanging on my wall it needs to be able to bear a lot of weight without slipping.&nbsp;  To tighten it what you can do is get&nbsp;some masking tape and just cut off a little strip…  …and stick it in the inside of the hinge right here.  The way this works is that there's a thicker area right there so that when you close it&nbsp;the joint tightens. But the plastic tends to wear down with time. So by putting the tape there you fill out the area more and make it tighter. There's only a small specific part where it's needed, but I use a whole strip so it doesn't move around to much. With just one layer it might still slip&nbsp;so usually I put two strips just in case. That makes it almost impossible to budge. The more strips you add of course, the more it tightens. Just be careful if, for example, you get the corner lifting like below. I usually redo these if it happens.  Over time the tape eventually wears down and tears along the spot that's tightest. It does leave a bit of residue sometimes but it's easy to clean with some alcohol.","tags":["diy","lifehacks","recording/editing tools","tools/software"],"permalink":"/2016/11/tripod-quick-tip"},"/2016/11/book-review-imaginitive-realism":{"title":"Review of Imaginitive Realism by James Gurney","contents":" So this book has been on my wishlist for a while and I recently discovered bookdepository which is significantly cheaper for me where I live so I decided to try it out. Book Depository First of all you might want to know that the \"free\" part of the Book depository shipping is actually included in the price and differs depending on where you buy it from. I only realized this because I had someone in the US buy it for me and they told me they actually paid even less than the price I was seeing (which was still ~10 dollars less than amazon). They had no problem putting in my address here in Argentina though. Apparently it's just where the site is seeing you coming from so you could probably use a secure VPN to get around this, but I have no idea how legal that might be or if that breaks their terms of use or something. They said 15 days max to arrive, but there are crazy import restrictions in my country, so it probably got delayed by customs. It took nearly a month and a half to arrive since they shipped it out. If you're in Argentina I&nbsp;still had to go pick it up and pay $50 pesos, so door-to-door is still not working properly. At least they did not open the package or anything. Packaging It was pretty nicely packed in the box you see in the video. In fact I've been struggling without how I'm going to ship paintings if I make them on stretched canvas and I'm going to copy their idea in part&nbsp;because it doesn't require me to buy a box. It's basically made out of one long strip of cardboard cut like the diagram below.   The&nbsp;black lines are cuts. The dotted sections are folds. Then the green parts are where it's glued together. The red is just there to highlight that that part is a fold and NOT a cut. The box edges itself where a bit damaged, but it's way longer than the book and this protected the book quite well.&nbsp;It has a few marks, nothing noticeable. A corner had started to become de-laminated, but I put some acrylic medium (because it won't yellow) in-between and left it pressed beneath my printer until it dried, and now you can hardly tell. For such a nice book I would have preferred to buy a hardcover version but&nbsp;it's only available as a paperback. And I absolutely loved this book, and I think all artists will find something helpful in it, but I think if you're like me and you already know how to draw from observation but are struggling to draw more from your imagination, you'll will find this the most useful. Book Review What does it cover? / Who is it for? I think it's important to note first&nbsp;what this book does and doesn't cover. I would personally like to reach the point some day where I can draw from imagination mostly without reference. That I think requires two main things. Being able to draw through construction and amassing a large visual library. I made a little oversimplified diagram for the video. Obviously people don't follow this perfectly, even me and maybe I'm missing stuff because I'm obviously still somewhere between the first two blocks, but you get the point.  This book doesn't cover those two thing under the third block that I mentioned. Instead it's more about helping to bridge the gap between the first and third blocks&nbsp;in other ways and how you can create works from your imagination with the aid of reference and other techniques. It's not a step by step how to book (though he does show you his steps and process a lot). Instead it's best to think of it like an encyclopedia of illustration techniques. Structure The book is divided into sections by these really nice full page paintings on a black background so they're relatively easy to find. Still for the most part it's more like an encyclopedia. Each sub-section listed in the table of contents is a two page spread. Then at the end there's a glossary, a list of recommended reading, a list of Gurney's work and an index.  Content If you follow Gurney's blog the book came to be in part from the subjects and questions on his blog. So it feels like a very natural extension of it. There are a lot of maquettes, models, and dinosaurs. And inversely sometimes you can look stuff up from the book in his blog for more details, especially his tools and supplies. For example I had no idea what he meant by a waxer.  I went to google it&nbsp;(it was not in the glossary), nothing really came up&nbsp;until I put \"waxer paste up tool\" and one of the results was his blog. So it's best to&nbsp;search his site for anything you don't understand or might want more details on. In google you can do the following:&nbsp;\"searchterm site:http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com\" without quotes.  Now I'm the highlighting note taking type and although you can't see what notes I took on the book itself, I don't like to mark my books. The way I take notes is I take a photo then OCR it if necessary (more on that at the end).&nbsp;And in this book&nbsp;I found a lot of interesting stuff. I highlighted over 100 things.  I also really liked that he did a lot of research into other artist's methods, so I discovered a lot of artists I'd never heard of that I'll be looking into.  I'll put the full list under the read more if you're curious. There's also probably even more in the recommended reading section (I've not combed through it yet) which you can read in the amazon preview. And he also shows you his process for different pieces and how he used a certain technique in a painting, so that was extremely useful and I made quite a large list of things to try. It's a bit unintelligible though without the book as context. You'll probably be seeing me try them if you follow me on twitter, instagram, or facebook. Overall it was exactly what I needed. There were obviously some techniques I already knew or discovered on my own in some way, but he has a great way of explaining that made me see even techniques I already knew in new way. The following are a few of my favorite parts&nbsp;and it was really hard to narrow it down to these. Storyboards  In this section he goes into detail on how he used storyboarding to plan his Dinotopia book. What I found interesting is that he used the storyboard in part to help plan the plot and the actual final text was the last thing he wrote. I've been struggling with finishing a book I'm writing for a while now, so I thought it couldn't hurt to try this approach. My book is just a regular novel, no illustrations, but I'm a very visual thinker and I can see a storyboard helping out a lot, especially with action scenes and stuff like that. Perspective Grid  Now as a digital artist I'm very familiar with using perspective grids. They're quite easy to set up in Photoshop, but traditionally they're more of a challenge. Recently someone on the internet came up with this idea of using elastic which I thought was pure genius, but for perspective points that are very far a part or in odd places it'd still be uncomfortable.          View this post on Instagram           Perspective drawing with thin string:) A post shared by  Reza Asgaripour (@architectdrw) on Sep 21, 2016 at 12:49pm PDT   I really like Gurney's approach here for those extreme cases. He draws the slanted lines only along on the edges of the drawing making it easy to find the slope of a line without having a perspective grid pre-drawn on the paper. So I thought that was a neat approach. Scrap File  This might seem like a very obvious one. I think most of us save reference images from the web, but I like the reasons he gives for keeping actual physical reference cut from magazines and such. Specifically that if you use google, everyone gets the same first few results and also that it's easier to reference the color from an image if it's printed because you can put them in the same light as your painting and the print quality tends to be a lot higher than what your printer can do. So that opened my eyes to keeping some physical reference as well. Shapewelding  Next is a technique he calls shapewelding. And it's one of the sections of the book that really made something click in my head. The idea of shapewelding I think is similar to that of lost edges, but with value instead. It's always tempting to want to differentiate the edges of objects when their values are similar, but this illustrates how well doing the exact opposite works, especially for simplifying compositions, something that I've always had a bit of trouble with. Eye Tracking  Something I really liked about the whole composition section in general was that it didn't just go over the usual rules you hear about composition. In this section specifically it dispels a lot of myths about how the eye moves through an image. The reality is that no two people view an image in the same way and the places we look are primarily determined by the story being told in the image. Which I think makes a lot more sense. Anyways I hope you found this review helpful. If you have any questions leave a comment, otherwise please consider subscribing/following me. I don't have many books at hand to review but I've been thinking of reviewing some of the books that you can find in the public domain as I work my way through them. If you want me to do more in-depth reviews like this on newer books please consider supporting me on patreon. How I Research / Work Through Books I might expand this into another post when I&nbsp;have actually worked through most of the book. How I Research for Fiction Books So doing research for the book I mentioned I'm writing I bought a lot of old used physical books. I did't mind highlighting them but it was a complete mess because I make so many highlights. I didn't want to have to scan them all to make myself a more usable PDF (even the notes themselves are hard to then extract, only method I've found is the Goodreader app on the iPad). In the end I found this app called eHighlighter. Basically you take a photo, it OCRs it (Optical Character Recognition, basically it converts images&nbsp;to text), and it's easy to organize the highlights by book. There are free apps that can OCR photos but none really aimed at books like this ones. It works decently enough. It's a bit finicky with years, quotes, weird symbols, and curved photos/lines, but it wasn't as bad as any of the other options (like scanning the book, or transcribing the highlights myself). I then take all these notes, dump them into Scrivener and further mark/highlight them to differentiate different types of notes.&nbsp;It's basically a condensed version of the book, a reverse engineering of the author's outline, and makes it a lot easier to see connections and get the big picture. How I Work Through Art Books Obviously art books don't require such complex orderly notes. You can usually get a sense for how good an art book is from just the pictures. When I was&nbsp;younger and would go to the library/bookstore I would just look at the pictures more than the text. I wasn't as serious about art and I didn't even think of working through a book like I do now.&nbsp;At least I made some notes about which books looked good, but I wish I'd made more detailed notes because it's hard finding many of the books I used to read and they're all in spanish when I do. But I've never really worked myself through an art book so densely packed with information.&nbsp;Even with my anatomy book, which I've worked through many parts of now, it's only really about the diagrams. Working through it is not so much about reading it but copying and understand those diagrams, so I haven't had to highlight a lot of text. I can just leave a few of those colored sticky arrows. Some books already have an order to them. This is very typical of say perspective books for example. In those cases you can usually try to tackle on section at a time and literally work your way through the book. The highlights are usually few because you have to apply the information in a certain section until you learn it and by then it's mostly stuck in your head. I would suggest though marking areas that gave you a lot of trouble or which you'll be referencing often just so that they're easy to find. How I Break Down Complex Art Books But then there are more complex books like this one. At first I tried to&nbsp;use the sticky arrows to show many notes I was taking, but I ran out of arrows! I didn't really need the notes to be searchable&nbsp;though so I just took&nbsp;some quick photos. Additionally I made a list as you saw of all the artists (because of the review) and starred the ones I hadn't heard of so I could investigate those. I also made myself a list of things I'm going to try and since they're all different sorts of things and the book has no real order, I've re-ordered them for myself, dividing them into supplies/tools, styles, and methods, reference (techniques/modeling methods), and general advice. Then ordered each section from easiest to hardest to just stuff I don't have the materials for. The goal much like before was&nbsp;to condense the book into something that's a lot more manageable and a lot less intimidating. I've done this before to some extent with public domain books because you can get them in a PDF, but never quite like this. If you're working through a PDF you can color code your highlights to signify the sections I mentioned, but I think it's still better to have an actual list as well if you can take the time to write it down or figure out how to extract those highlights. List of Artists Mentioned in the Book I sorted&nbsp;the list by first name.

This was the chart I kept for the drying tests. Temperatures were around 12 C for those days like I mentioned in the video. Probably around 20 C inside, maybe less (heater is off at night).  Regarding the \"watercolors\" I know I called them a watercolor substitute, but it's more like they've substituted watercolors for me specifically because they're slower drying, portable, and won't crack. But they're more like something between gouache and oils and yet they have a distinct sticky feel (like warm honey). They're more opaque then watercolors, but they stay wet longer, and yet they have that tendency to stay in that sticky watercolor stage on paper. My mix is about 1:1, more and they flow too much, less and they'd dry in the box because it's not airtight (if the box were airtight I could use less). I also like them because I can paint at the consistency they're at without accidently over diluting them with water like I usually do watercolors. For example, for a sky, I'll outline the object, then I'll go back on the paper and spread the color around with a water-brush there. One thing I forgot to mention is that you should use professional grade acrylics for them if you want them to keep their opacity. Additionally if you like gouache you can mix in a bit of titanium white with all your colors to make the even more opaque. I will do a video with them in the future.","tags":["acrylics","art supplies","diy","videos"],"permalink":"/2016/07/how-to-keep-acrylic-paints-wet-retarders"},"/2016/07/skull-painting-narrated-timelapse-acrylics-on-plastic":{"title":"Skull Painting Narrated Timelapse (Acrylics on Plastic)","contents":"Initial SketchUnderpaintingSkull Finished Painting  I did a lot of research several tests before trying the techniques I tried here. And the painting seems to be stable for now, but I can’t guarantee anything, please do your own tests with your own materials and draw your own conclusions. Usually if there are problems it tends to happen within the first few days. As of now (two weeks), the painting is stable enough. The paint has not cracked or peeled (not even from purposely trying to peel it with tape), and the plastic (it’s HIPS plastic) is in great condition (the medium heat from the blow dryer did not bend it out of shape). Update: I did do a swab test (softly rubbing a wet cotton swab on the surface) at two weeks and I did get some very minor lifting in the background, but still nothing with the tape and nothing where I then painted the light in with gray over that red background. So I don’t think it’s something to worry about as long as I add an isolation layer of pure medium over everything. Whatever lose pigments remain from the under-bound paint look like they’re easily contained by another proper layer of paint. Overall it satisfies me. I’ll report back further once I add this layer.The only thing is I painted all the way to the edge and the paint is kind of ragged there, liable to being accidentally peeled from handling roughly. Before I didn’t paint to the edges because I used the edges to handle the canvas paper. I kept doing that for a while even though I started to secure my pages because they were already marked for it. But for this I thought there was no point, well now I realize it’s probably better to continue that habit. Also all the water made the plastic stick to the paper I was using to hang it from. I managed to unstick it and rub it off with just some water, but some of the gesso came off. I repainted it, and it’s all fine. Not really the fault of the plastic (just the sheer amount of water would have ruined a painting in canvas paper), but more bad planning on my part.  Tests Propylene Glycol (Retarder) The complete chart will be available in the next post when I post the tutorial on the stay wet palette and I’m planning on redoing it, along with more detailed strength tests, in the summer. But basically, I set out propylene glycol in different proportions to very cheap crafts acrylic (from 3:1 to 1:3) and they have all dried within a week and have not left the paint sticky in any way. And it’s winter here where I live so it’s not that it was hot and that helped it. The paint films also seem remarkably strong (only tested through touch). I expected more problems at the higher ratios but there weren’t any. A thin brushed on layer of pure PG also evaporates within a couple days and can be made to evaporate within the day by blow-drying the painting on medium heat for a few minutes. It’ll still remain sticky for a few hours, but you’ll have helped the initial moisture evaporate and after that it should be completely dry by the next day and not sticky at all. The paint didn’t reactivate or anything at that point. Water I also tried some similar quick tests with water. There was no noticeable problems when diluting excessively as long as the paint already had some base to adhere to (the recommended is usually 50% for mediums, less for tube paints). Canvas paper works out of the box and so would anything pre-primed. Plastic needs some gesso (I used 2 coats) or a relatively thick underpainting (if you did the entire underpainting diluting only with medium, that would probably work as well) and should also be sanded beforehand to provide a better physical bond for the paint. But once you’ve got that thick base of paint with a good mechanical bond, you’re good to go. Additionally I found this reply by Golden (scroll down past the video) regarding water saying that at least with their paints this isn’t true and you can get away with going much more than 50% with tube acrylics and they’ll still have decent adhesion. They also described some methods for testing this similar to what I’d used. Also they confirmed as I suspected (because when you do hear about acrylics peeling it’s always on a recent painting), any problems with adhesion should be apparent fairly quickly, within days. That’s why I’m confident the skull painting is fine at this point. Update: I found a better instructions for their test, that’s a bit different from what was suggested in that link. HIPS (High Impact Polystyrene) Plastic as a Painting Substrate I used 0.5mm plastic for this painting. More than half a year ago I put two pieces of plastic on my window, 0.3mm and 1mm taped with masking tape, with one part covered in a thin layer of gesso. There has only been noticeable yellowing (it’s too little to properly photograph) on the exposed plastic. 0.3mm did worse than 1mm. When I took off the masking tape (which by that point had turned a disgusting yellow) and took off the gesso with some alcohol, the plastic looked brand new, and unlike paper would be, was not contaminated by the yellowing masking tape. Based on this I would keep 0.5mm plastic to do studies. It’s about the same price, if not cheaper than canvas paper per cm, at least where I live. Leave 1mm plastic for a good painting. And 2mm for something rigid that can replace canvas (1mm is still very flexible). I wouldn’t use this for a commission or sell a painting on plastic without warning the person, at least not at this point in my tests, but I am looking into the more expensive UV resistant plastics for those situations. I’m also going to test whether it’s possible to wrap the plastic in canvas, much like MDF panels are, but without the downsides of MDF (it’s always humid where I live and I have an ever growing hatred of anything made from MDF), at which point there should be no UV related problems with such thick protection from the canvas. These I feel are just a better replacement for papers / canvas papers (which warp, crease, and yellow if in contact with non-archival stuff), cheap bad quality canvases, expensive woods, and unavailable woods (they don’t sell birch where I live, the blasphemy) or unavailable alternatives (I can’t find the name, but there was this brand that made some sort of archival plastic board, or at least they claimed it was archival, never tried it, but it was interesting. Edit: Found it.. Edit2: Found a similar board.). The bigger issue than yellowing I think before these tests satisfy me is how strong the plastic remains. I know from experience trying to make PVC bows that if the PVC is old the tube will shatter with relatively minimal pressure, but this is kind of hard to test with small pieces of HIPS, and even if I were to put out bigger pieces to test, a sheet is not a tube, and HIPS plastic is either flexible under 1mm or super rigid at 2mm. So I haven’t thought of a good way to do it yet. It would need to involve various samples and some level of precision when applying pressure. And if I had the stuff to test that, I probably wouldn’t be trying to find cheap alternative substrates… Adherance Tests Additionally I tried painting straight on the plastic on the glossy side, the matte side, and the matte side sanded. I would avoid the glossy side unless you thoroughly sand the gloss away. The acrylic seems to stick okay to the matte side, but it’s easily peeled. If you sand it though it offers incredible resistance. Just remember how badly acrylic like to stick to plastic palettes, that’s how it sticks, now imagine it’s sanded. The bond is pretty strong. Just be careful when sanding, especially machine sanding, to wear a suitable mask to protect against the dust. If you like to read very technical stuff, Golden wrote an article once on plastics as a substrate which you might find useful. Unfortunately they don’t note whether the plastics tested had any built in UV protection. PS: Not sponsored by Golden or anything. I just genuinely liked their products when I lived in the US and they also have an incredible amount of research and information on acrylics. I haven’t seen any other companies do anything like it and it was a big part of what attracted me to the brand in the first place.","tags":["acrylics","art supplies","artwork","portfolio"],"permalink":"/2016/07/skull-painting-narrated-timelapse-acrylics-on-plastic"},"/2016/07/art-supply-haul-updates":{"title":"Art Supply Haul + Updates","contents":" Sorry for the lateness I had a lot of trouble uploading because it was so long.

Canvas texture smoother (compared to 3) A bit of titanium white, couple drops of turps, and a bit of liquin, mixed to kind of a milky consistency. Tends to really sink into the canvas but smoothes fine with a brush, and ended up with the least texture. Can be wiped nearly clean (compared to 3). Pure titanium white. Doing it with just a brush was impossible (might be possible with zinc white) so I used my thumb and that also helped reduce the canvas texture. And afterwards I wiped away the excess paint with a rag but it's hard to wipe away completely.  To avoid using turps I think the best solution would be to just prime and sand the canvas smooth so that paint doesn't get stuck in the canvas texture.

You could even use a two color palette to great effect. James Gourney has some great examples of two palette paintings, this one I think is one of the most striking. The Zorn palette is technically two color, but I see it more as a three color palette because the black serves as a substitute blue.

I have saved a few of my favorite poses for next time so hopefully there will be more to compare. The anatomy book I like to use is Classic Human Anatomy by Valerie L. Winslow. If you can only afford one book get this one. The only downside is it's all drawn but I have found no other book so well done. As for Michael Hampton who I mentioned, he has a wonderful blog full of sketches that I found very helpful. He often shows his reference and I recommend you first attempt to do the pose from the reference, then look at his approach for help/comparison. He also has a book (Figure Drawing - Design and Invention) that looks very good. The lightning bold figure drawing method I mentioned can be found here.

The original plan was to just hang the camera but it moved to much even if I tied it to the shelf, plus it cast a horrible shadow. In the future I’m thinking I will hang it, but making some sort of arm that sticks out from the shelf to properly stabilize the camera. It doesn’t need to be bulky since it won’t bear any weight and to not get a shadow I just have to get the camera in the right position. I thought about making an overhead arm for the tripod but I’m not sure how I’d attach the camera.

I find them a bit silly in general because no one really goes through with them, and then personally I would find it depressing having to set goals at some arbitrary time every year that I might not be able to accomplish (and it won’t be for lack of trying). Not that I think setting goals is bad idea, in fact, I think it’s a really good idea, but not like this. I have to want or need them.  There’s no point in my opinion in searching too hard for a goal to set if you’re never going to want it enough to go through with it. So my goals are set at random times when I need some extra motivation if I need to get something done, or some extra organization when I want to do something. I tend to try to take on too much all at once. If they’re hard goals I also need to set them when I’m sure I’ve been feeling well, and when they’re easier they need to be achievable whether I’m feeling horrible or not. When I follow those general rules it’s unlikely I won’t accomplish whatever I set out to do. This time my goal setting just happened to sort of coincide with the new year (I published this late, but I wrote this up in January). Also I’m currently stuck in a sort of health limbo for at least a year at the pace I’m improving so it also happens they are for a year. I’m not feeling well enough to work/study full time but I’m well enough to do a bit of something everyday so I really want to use the otherwise wasted time to make an honest effort at making a living from all the things I know. If I succeed, great, if I’m stuck in limbo for longer I’ll keep trying, and if this doesn’t go well, but I’m feeling better, I’ll go back to school as I initially wanted. I’ve divided this into sections, and for each goal I’ve put in a blockquote how it might translate to content that you’ll see. Only the starred goals have due dates for this year. Others are just general things that can be dropped. I’ll be happy if I can at least get all the ones with due dates done. I’d plan it by the time each thing takes but there’s always too many variables at play. $$Time_{f}=Time_{i}^3 + Life + Health - Luck$$ This has never not held true for me. Goals Website* This is what has delayed this post. I’ve been working non-stop for the past month on this. I’ve scrounged together enough money to buy myself a domain so I’m doing it. The good/bad news is it’s not enough for hosting but that means:  Tutorial/s on how to set up a site with free hosting (via Github) using a static site generator.  Getting a domain is optional, but without having to get a hosting service, it’s really really affordable (~$10 dollars). Static site generators might look scary if you’ve just started learning HTML. I know I used to grown every time I needed to use a command line program, and I’m sure plenty of people have been equally put off by the little black box and UI-less programs so I will go through every little step, especially those that are often glossed over and assumed as obvious in the documentation. I’ll also go into making your own layout and theme, but again, it’s fairly easy to install a pre-made one or edit one a bit to suit you.  If there’s an interest in HTML, CSS, jQuery, I can also do a few tutorials on those.  I’m also learning PHP &amp; Wordpress because I have a few potential clients that want their site redone from scratch with a dynamic generator, but I think there’s plenty of tutorials out there for that. We’ll see. I’ve only just dived in, but the code looks relatively easy after setting up my static site generator. Patreon Animation* Since I don’t have much work to show off, I want to put a lot of effort into this and make it a mix of all I know. My page is up if you want to support me but I wouldn’t really call it launched yet.  After Effects Quick Start Guide  Art Tutorials Video Series* Pick one subject and record all at once otherwise I tend to jump around everywhere.  Considering anatomy (starting with hands because I had a request), guide to programs (in general), or guide to Photoshop. If you have any suggestions leave a comment.  Organization My Room* …is a mess. There’s a bunch of projects just in organizing it, some of which I’m already working on like the: Angled Drawers* I’ve mentioned these a few times. They are delayed because I hit a bit of a snag with the varnish I have to sand them all again and redo the stain. Somebody kill me, please.  How To for these.  Camera Rig* Recording drawings/paintings is almost impossible without one.  Timelapses w/ commentary!  Custom Blender Shortcuts I want to learn Blender. I already know in general what tools I tend to use in a 3D programs so it’s just learning where stuff is and a lot of that for me relies on creating my own set of shortcuts. This usually doesn’t take more than a day or two, but this is Blender, I’ve been on this for nearly a week already.  Video explaining my methodology. A demo with blender, one for photoshop. All the shortcut config files.  Organize Hard Drive Need to make a better system in general and narrow down the number of programs/places I keep stuff in.  Review of all the system and any software used.  Logging Method/New Notebook It looks like I’ll finally be filling up my first notebook. I find notebooks aesthetically pleasing, and I love to make them, but I never know what to put in them. I don’t really like to sketch in a sketchbook unless I’m out and about. I hate any sort of journaling and most of my writing needs to end up on my computer anyway so using paper just adds an extra step. But a few months ago, before my health had started improving, I was in a very bad mood because I didn’t have energy to do anything, not even things I wanted, and especially anything that demanded any sort of physical exertion. Going out of the house was chore. It was almost always for doctors. I felt like a caged animal, wasting away at my chair, lazy, not doing anything with my life. I knew it wasn’t true, but I couldn’t help but feel like it was. Then I had the idea of logging everything I did because I was doing things, they were just things that were hard to quantify. Just because I threw away a sketch, my project/experiment was a failure, or even just if I’d learned a few new things about programming and I had nothing to show for it, it didn’t mean I didn’t do those things or that I didn’t gain anything from them. Well that little logging experiment turned into a huge success for me. Really improved my mood and I’ve been keeping it up for 5 months or so. But now it means I’m going to be using up notebooks. I have 2-3 half-used ones but most of them have ended up being used as scratchpads, and anything with decent paper I’ve saved for art, so I want to make/start one just for logging. And also by that time I hope to have a proper system in place. I’m still experimenting with different formats in my current one. It’s a bit of a mess at times.  Post on logging method. Post/video on how to bind a book, and the secret to straight pages without a guillotine. I always see book binding tutorials that either skip this part and leave the pages all messy (which drives me nuts), or they use a guillotine and who the hell has one of those on hand?  Scan Work/Scanning System* There’s not much past work to scan because I haven’t done much in the past years and everything before that has either been thrown out or is so old I don’t really want to show it. I just dread this because I have the slowest scanner ever. There will also be lots of newer sketches. I’ve been keeping up with those, but I really need a better system. There’s also some books I’d like to digitize for myself since they aren’t available as ebooks. I did one by hand, it was a nightmare, never again.  Might modify the camera rig I’m planning to also function as a scanner.  Ongoing (Art) 3-4 Sketches a Week I finally have the energy to do this so I’ll be working up to one page a day (2-3 hours) once I have the time.  More art.  One Painting a Month I need to get the camera rig made first though.  Timelapse paintings (some of the sketches as well) w/ commentary.  Sketch Before Restarting Painting This might seem like an odd one but I’m a perfectionist when it comes to any realistic paintings from imagination so what happens is that I restart them over and over and over again and rarely finish. Practicing with the same painting makes it incredibly easy to see any improvement, but, the cons are huge and I don’t recommend it. It can be really really frustrating. You’ve got to really still want it months later on the hundredth try. The paintings I want to do have always been more than enough motivation for me to overcome the frustration. I mean, what better subject to practice with then the one that motivate you? And it has also helped that I don’t expect to finish the painting/s anymore. I’ve come to see them as practice that will someday hopefully pay off. Is it a bad habit? Maybe. Does it get me paintings? Yes, a lot. So I wouldn’t be bothering to change much where it not for the fact that I end up with nothing to show for all that practice. Even if I finish (and that’s incredibly unlikely) I’ve only got the final piece. I might give patreons a behind the scenes look at a few of my attempts with any future paintings that take multiple takes, but otherwise old ones have long since been deleted, and the pressure of sharing all my attempts would probably just be too much while painting. The beauty of them is that I stopped putting pressure on myself to finish, just to improve in the hopes of finishing. These aren’t the only types of paintings I do otherwise I’d have nothing to show at all, but they are where the bulk of my practice comes from, and also any studies or things I learn are usually for those paintings. The breakdown is something like this: 50% Failed attempts at realistic paintings from imagination.10% Sketches from imagination (mainly for myself).10% Paintings &amp; Studies not from imagination.20% Studies to improve the paintings from imagination (not very presentable usually).","tags":["random","uncategorized"],"permalink":"/2016/02/new-years-resolutions"},"/2016/02/final-site-design-brainstorm":{"title":"Final Site Design Brainstorm","contents":"Because the first brainstorm ended up not being used (design wise) I did another one. This time I put more thought into how the mobile side would function. Sometimes as designers we’re tempted to include things in our designs that look nice or can be attractive on a desktop interface, but just slow down the site and make it annoying on mobile platforms. So I only left stuff to the top that I felt was useful for users. You’re usually not going to try to go through a blog’s archive tree from mobile for example. But at the same time it’s not completely inaccessible (there’s a link to the page). I think decreased functionality is just as bad as interfering functionality. By interfering functionality I mean things like the following. These are just things that annoy me as a user. Yes most phones are getting bigger screens but some of us are still stuck with 3.5 inch screens.  Fixed Search/Menu Header - They are really annoying on screens smaller than 3.5 inches (original iPhone size). Popups - Don’t, just no, don’t do it. Lightboxes - I have mixed opinions about these. If they’re super fast they’re great, but otherwise they suck. It’s a fine line. I ended up using inline thumbnails and pictures with easy links to the full image. Un-hoverable Menus - Make sure if you have menus they “hover” when tapped once on mobile devices instead of going straight to the link or appearing then disappearing. Infinite Scrolling - I would strongly advice against it. 90% of sites with infinite scrolling still crash my iPod Touch (4th gen). Even on a desktop this is a bad idea if users are likely to scroll past the 3rd-4th page (who doesn’t want their users to read a lot?). Each page that you load is added to the memory and therefore slows down the site. There will be a point at which it becomes sluggish on almost any device. The only way you might get away with infinite scrolling is if you only have text. No Next/Previous Gestures - I don’t know who thought this was a good idea, but some blogs allow you to “turn” to the next post. But all that happens is that you accidently turn a page when you don’t want to. Anything that messes with the font size when rotating the device.

I’ve had four Andy Drawers (two red, two grey) for years. They’re great. I really like them because they’re really light and portable but at the same time they do have some problems. The first is the dust. This wasn’t so bad before but now I live somewhere really dusty and I had to stop storing any sort of paper in them because they’d get all gross. The second is that if you happened to get the ones with a matte finish (grey), the drawers don’t slide nearly as nicely as with the glossy ones. Lastly, only two really fit under my desk, I can’t see anything when I go search for something, I bump into them with my chair all the time, and the other two are always in the way when I don’t need them, and too far when I do. So apart from fixing the first two problems I’ve also decided to put them one on top of the other both to save space and fix the light problem.  Materials 2cm Screw - If you’re in the US you’ll probably be able to find the exact same type that came with it, just longer. I got the next closest thing. Plastic - Thin rigid sheets work best, but I had already made mine from flexible plastic a while back. I’m not sure what this plastic is used for, but it’s sold at the hardware store here. Steps Drilling the Necessary Holes Bottom of DrawerCorner w/ Sides First, decide which is going to be the top drawer. Always be checking before you do anything that you’ve got the right one and in the right orientation(you can tell this by the indents on the drawer guides). Next you’ll need to take off it’s wheels and turn it over. Undo the four screws holding everything together. One side will come out quite easily. The other you’ll probably have to unscrew on of the screws holding the X shaped back.  Original Screw If you found the right screws and they fit nicely, you’ll only have to drill through the top drawers two sides. If not, once you’re done drilling you’ll have to drill through the corners as well.  Unless you didn’t find the right length screw you don’t need to do anything to the drawers going on the bottom. Just undo the screws holding the metal mesh. You can leave the mesh or take it out depending on if your screws reach. Alternatively if you could only find really long screws, you could drill all the way through the top sides of the bottom drawers and hold everything together with a nut. Note: I had my dad drill the holes because he’s much stronger than me. They were really really hard to drill. I don’t know what kind of metal these are made out of, but at one point it almost looked like we wouldn’t be able to do it. But it is possible! They weren’t exactly centered but we fixed that when expanding the corner holes. Attaching the Two Drawers Before we attach anything you should at least cut the pieces of plastic that go on top and in between the two drawers. Careful they’re not perfect squares. You’ll also need to make some holes in these for the four screws.  Bottom of Drawers w/ Plastic Sheet Once you’re done (I cut all the plastic all at once a few months ago), put in the four new screws from the top and place/hang the plastic onto them. Now slowly tilt it over onto the other drawers and everything should fall into place. Make sure everything is facing the right way. Now you can screw in everything nice and tight. If you’re screws don’t quite lay flush it doesn’t matter as long as nothing falls apart when you’re handling them roughly. If one of the drawers is leaning one way or the other, just unscrew the X shaped back and flip it 180 degrees. That should fix it. You can place the top plastic beneath the mesh as well now. This is the only one really that can be put on at any point. Protecting Everything from Dust  First Two Plastic Sheets I had some leftover flexible plastic a while back so I cut them up and taped them above the guides for each of the drawers. I thought I about putting them inside the drawers themselves, but they wouldn’t protect the contents nearly as well and I didn’t have enough to completely cover the inner sides. The problem with what I did though was that the tape kept coming off all the time and the drawers would snag on the plastic. I highly suggest you use rigid plastic sheets if you can. Those you’ll probably be able to get away with just using some tape to hold them in place. The only thing I could think of that stuck well but could still be removable was hot glue. I know, not the most elegant solution but it worked really well. First I’d glue all along one guide in short 10-15cm segments. Since it was flexible plastic, doing it in short segments wasn’t a problem and I didn’t have to be in as much of a hurry to place everything before the glue cooled. Once one side was secure then I’d go to the other side and pull the plastic really taught. This is only important for this step and only really along the front.  Plastic Closeup As of now everything seems to be holding quite well (I’ll confirm in a week which is usually what it took the tape to get ruined). Update: They held up for a few months, but occasionally need to be re-glued. In the future I plan to replace these with rigid plastic so they can even be used as tiny shelves for papers and such, but for now I’m afraid that’d cause them to sag. Smooth Gliding When you’re putting the wheels back you’ll have some leftover wheels make sure the drawers get the nice ones so even with a lot of weight they’ll roll around nice and smooth. Lastly, you might have noticed I flipped the colors. The drawers all now open and close smoothly, not as smoothly as red against red, but it’s a vast improvement overall. And you’re done! Not sure yet what to do with the metal meshes I didn’t use. I’ll edit this if I find some use for them. The wheels though are sure to go into some future project or other.","tags":["diy"],"permalink":"/2016/01/modifying-ikea-andy-drawers"},"/2016/01/color-swatches":{"title":"Color Swatches","contents":"I’ve heard of artists keeping a notebook with just random color swatches as an exercise in observing color and I found that interesting.

I’m trying to keep all my sketches clean and presentable like I talked about in my resolutions post. Now I struggled a bit with the dark shading in the tree sketch and I want to mention this because it just so happened I had started to read a Course in Pencil Sketching by Ernest Watson, and it mentioned something interesting that I’d never considered and that is the surface on which you’re drawing and whether it’s hard/soft. I would usually draw on a hard surface because you can get more precise lines, but as the book explains this is a horrible surface for shading. So those blocks of shading at the bottom are me experimenting with different surfaces and pencil combinations. My favorite where the last two. I used a 4B (Lyra) pencil and did two passes over two surfaces (4 &amp; 2 paper towels thick). The order didn’t seem to matter. I’m not going to do that for all sketches, but it’s something to keep in mind for large areas of black like the grass. For general sketches I’ve moved over to drawing over a plastic folder filled with paper (where I keep my sketches).

I’ve also submitted this instructable to the Leftovers Challenge contest over there, so please vote for it if you like it.  I hate the basic push stick that comes with our table saw. It’s uncomfortable for nearly everything but especially for smaller cuts. I was doing a project that needed long (60cm) cuts as tiny as 1cm and I was going to chop of my fingers off if I attempted it with the included push stick. So in the moment I improvised and made myself a better push stick or as I like to call it, my helper hand, out of a scrap piece of wood. I’m sure there are better push sticks you can buy and I could come up with a few other designs, but this was about a fast, cheap, single material solution, plus you can put some of those scrap pieces of wood from larger projects to good use and you don’t have to worry about accidentally cutting the stick. The one in my right hand in the photo was the “prototype” I made in the moment out of a failed attempt at some fingers (hence the angle + grooves). I managed to make all my cuts with just that one and the white scrap piece to hold the wood down (so the reverse positions from above), but if I had made two it would have been even easier, I just didn’t have the time. So in this tutorial I’ll be finishing the second one, and making it a bit neater. It’ll get some cuts in it eventually, but the main surfaces on my first one where a bit uneven. Plus there’s less random cuts to ignore. Skip down to see some examples. Materials Wood - You’ll need a piece about the size of your hand and at least 2cm thick. I’m using a piece of MDF (my dad builds MDF cabinets). He always has relatively large scrap pieces like this one that he has no use for. When you grab it your fingers should be an inch of two from the bottom to make sure even with thicker pieces they don’t reach the blade. And then it should be just slightly longer than your hand when you’re grabbing it. Instructions Step 1: Marking and Cutting   My piece already had some earlier cuts so I cut away as many as possible. I couldn’t get rid of those two cuts, ignore them. To better illustrate everything I’ve numbered and color coded the actual cuts. I’ve tried two ways of doing this. I think this one is better because it’s smoother. I’ll let you battle it out with your saw if you want to do it different. See the second image for my measurements. This is for a 2cm piece with an outer L 1cm thick, sturdy but not too thick. The small white part will be cut away and the scribbled parts are the areas that will only be cut part way through. When I say raise the saw high it’s better but not necessary if you raise the saw as high as it will go. This is dangerous. Be extra careful if you do. Regardless you’ll still need it to be pretty high (I think around 2cm higher than the piece at least) otherwise you’ll cut too much. Edit: I’ve redone the pictures and some of the instructions. Hopefully it’s clearer now. Cut 1 &amp; 2 (Green &amp; Yellow)  For cut #1 (yellow) raise the saw high and cut until you reach mark #2 (yellow).  With cut #2, hold down the piece as shown so it doesn’t fly anywhere. Cut until it snaps inwards.  You’ll notice in the back, even with the saw raised, you’ll inevitably cut more than you need depending on how high you raise the saw. There’s ways to avoid this if this were a project where presentation was important, but it isn’t, and later you won’t be able to avoid this. Just ignore them. Step 3: Cut 3 (Orange) This cut would get cut away with time as you did thinner and thinner cuts, but I cut it anyway. Set the saw to just slightly less than half the piece (~1cm). It’s better to cut too little than too much. You can start from the outside with the [width of piece - saw width] then move inwards or do what I did and cut outwards.  I set the guide to [width of piece - (1cm + saw width)] and made the cut like you see in 3a then moved the guide, made a cut, moved the guide, made a cut and so on adding the width of the saw each time and cut outwards until the section was gone (3b).  Cut 4 (Red) Now we’re going to cut the other L. Keep the saw at ~1cm.  Copy the 2cm mark in red to the other side. We’ll be cutting with the “back” up. Now cut perpendicular to it until the highest point of the saw reaches the mark.  Do the same with 4b. You won’t need to mark it because you’ll already have the previous cut to guide you. When you flip it back around it should look like the second image below. It doesn’t matter that the cut went through to the edge.  Now to cut that last part off, what I did as you can see in 4c is with one hand I held the piece at about the right height and then with the guide set at 1cm cut in until that scribbled piece fell off. The first time I did this like I did cut #3 but what happens is that since you can’t cut into the little L bit sticking out you have to stop the saw way earlier and then you’d have to cut away at the remaining wood by hand. I managed, but the result was not very smooth. This method although a bit odd is better. And you’re done! See the next step for different ways to use them. Ideally you should make two, but you can make do with one and a block or at least one and one with and just the first two cuts. Use Examples Here’s some photos of me using them. They’ve completely replaced the push stick that came with the saw for me and it’s also really helped to just have something square on hand when cutting thin pieces where I either can’t put the miter guide where I need it, or it’s too far away. Plus since they’re made out of scraps there’s no hesitation about cutting into them. I can press a piece down over the saw and basically use them as an extension of my hands, greatly reducing any danger when doing otherwise dangerous or awkward cuts.

Patreons get access to the PSDs&nbsp;for both files.  The 3D head scan I used was: “Infinite, 3D Head Scan” by Lee Perry-Smith used under a CC-BY 3.0 License / Rendered under different Lighting Conditions (Click the link there and scroll down to download). You can download my ready made C4D scene here. In the future these are the types of things that if I heavily modified or made myself will be temporarily patreon exclusive. I’ll also probably use blender, but I’m currently still struggling with it. It doesn’t play nice with my graphics card and setting my own shortcuts has been much harder than I thought. I also still need to learn how to import/export models between programs properly. If you want to open the model and play around with C4D&nbsp;Maxon offers an \"unlimited\" demo (45 days with saving). You can also go to Virtual Lighting Studio like I mentioned in the video. You can add multiple different colored lights to that same head (and others) and move their positions around. The only thing you can’t do is change the skin texture like I did, but the site can still be incredibly useful. If you’d like to recreate the scene from scratch or understand more about what I did, there’s&nbsp;this video, and&nbsp;I’ve added the exact details of what I did after the read more. If you’re interested in learning more about subsurface scattering I came across this post on subsurface scattering, while researching the subject. Traditional artists especially might find it particularly useful. Setting up the Scene in C4D 3D programs tend to differ vastly on where settings are, but the same basic concepts apply if you want to try to get these yourself. The skin texture must be changed. Subsurface Scattering must be on with the matching color. And you must render with global illumination. There’s a video using this exact same head in C4D like I mentioned, but my exact methods were the following:  Drag the model into a blank scene to import it. It might be huge, reduce it to a reasonable size. It won’t import with textures or bump maps so you’ll need to add them. Create a material in the material editor, double click on it to open it’s properties. Under Bump &gt; Texture &gt; Load Image import the bump.jpg. Under Color &gt; Texture &gt; Load Image add the lambertian.jpg. If you’d like to mess around with weird skin colors you can add a Hue/Saturation effect within C4D (I forgot to mention in the video you could do this) or modify the texture outside C4D with a photo editing program. To do it within C4D go again to Color &gt; Texture &gt; Layer this time. It should change the texture to a layer, click on it and it should take you to the shader properties. From there you can go to Effect &gt; Hue / Sat / Lightness. I recommend making a separate material for each skin tone instead of editing the same one for each render. You’ll need to turn on subsurface scattering for each material under Luminance &gt; Texture &gt; Subsurface Scattering and set it to the corresponding skin color (to get back to this section, like you clicked the layer, click on Subsurface Scattering). You will notice there’s already some presets to get you started (Light Skin, Dark Skin). Oh, and one last thing, I also forgot to mention this. you’ll need to adjust the path length to some value between 0-2cm, it will depend on how big you imported the head. I would advice against using a standard light. Instead make a sphere or any object and a new material for it (and for each color you’re going to test). Turn on Luminance and set it to around 700-1000 depending on the distance. The object color doesn’t matter, only the color of the luminance setting. Note: I found white needs to be a bit brighter to get a similar effect to the other colors. I’m assuming it’s because it contains all the colors, and therefore at the same intensity it doesn’t shine through as much as say pure red.    I also added a soft infinite light at 14% Intensity so you could properly see the ear. Even in dim conditions, it’s rare that you don’t have some other source of light around the figure. Finally to get all this to actually render in the render settings don’t forget to turn on the Global Illumination under effects.&nbsp;The default settings might be a bit spotty. I’m not an expert with this but I managed to get it to render smoothly and fast by changing the following under Global Illumination.

The structure is finished but it’s the little details that are taking a long time. I don’t want to stop posting completely though so in the meantime I’ll be making a few posts about the things I did to make the project easier on myself. These will technically be posted in reverse order that I made them because I only have the prototypes now, I didn’t actually make the finished tools.

It’s not done yet, but if you want to support me check it out&nbsp;and/or share my posts. Paint Cans We all know what a pain it is to pour paint out. I tried to google to see if there was some sort of life hack for this but found none so I made my own. I honestly don’t even know why we still use cans shaped like they are. I get not using plastic because the metal is probably easier to recycle and more resistant (plus it keeps out light), but surely they could add better lids. This isn’t so much a problem on big cans for me, so this solution doesn’t work for them. With bigger cans you usually need to use large amounts at once and you tend to use the can all at once (say to paint a room) so controlling the amount isn’t such a problem. But with small cans this works great and I’m sure you could modify this to something larger if you find a large enough bottle, or you could pour larger cans into smaller empty ones and reuse them if say you bought something in bulk but only use a small amount at a time.  Materials  Soda Bottle or any Plastic Bottle that has a Recycling 1 - PET or PETE plastic is resistant to most chemicals (mineral spirits, etc) you’re bound to come in contact with if you’re doing art/diy/woodworking (so paints, varnishes, turps, etc). Here’s the PET specific chart because some of them are missing from the next link. If you’re working with other types of chemicals you can check to see what plastic type is resistant to them. This is the most comprehensive chart I found. Great to keep on hand for reference. Keep in mind the substance will only contact the plastic shortly so even if it doesn’t have excellent resistance this will still work. Scissors/Razor Blade Calipers (Optional) - Makes it easier to get the diameter of the opening right. Silicone Caulk/Epoxy Glue (Optional) - To permanently glue it in place. Steps First you’re going to want to measure the diameter of the opening of the can. You’re going to cut slightly bigger than that. You can just use the groove in the sealed cap for reference. If it fits that, it’ll fit the can.  Then with the calipers it’s easy to mark this line on the bottle but you could also just cut it by eye and adjust it as you go on.  Once it’s cut clean the bottle, let it dry if whatever you’re going to be capping does not mix with water. Place it over the sealed can. It should fit snug against the cap/opening.  Now you can open the can and hold it in place and pour. If it’s a glue or a varnish if you just let it get around the rim and leave it for a day or two it should seal by itself. I’d still suggest holding it, but you won’t need to be as careful. You can do it with one hand like I did below and wipe the cap with the other when you’re done. You cap it like a regular bottle and it’s much easier to clean if it’s a very sticky substance.&nbsp;Update:&nbsp;A&nbsp;few weeks have passed and I finished the can so decided to take it ff, and it&nbsp;actually took some effort, so the seal is good when it does end up forming. If you want this to be permanent you can glue it in place with some silicone caulk or epoxy glue or something. The can edge should be clean/dry when you do this so it’d be best to do this the first time you open the can. If the substance is very light sensitive you should keep this in a dark place or alternatively cover the plastic cap with a layer of paint or a dark plastic bag or something. Final Result  And there you go! Easy cheap solution, and you can also then use the bottom of those bottles to hold your paint/varnish like so. And with some clean film you can get it to keep for a day or two if you have a small amount left over (depends on the substance). You can also leave your brush dipped in a little bit of turpentine or mineral spirits if you’ll be using it for a few days straight and don’t want to be cleaning it constantly. Basically it’s a great endless supply of disposable containers. If the cap on the bottle gets stuck you can also just un-stick the entire thing (if you didn’t make it permanently) and just make it a brand new one.","tags":["diy","lifehacks","tools/software"],"permalink":"/2015/12/easily-pour-paint-from-small-cans"},"/2015/11/varnished-chest":{"title":"Varnished Chest","contents":"I’ve been busy with a big project so in the meantime, here’s the chest again.

The best way really to learn how to draw something is to draw it until you can draw it without reference. There’s no way around the hard boring work that studies can be. Looking at videos and posts will help guide you on what to observe and pay attention to, and mistakes to avoid, but nothing can replace practice. A great place to get reference images for studies is morgueFile. You could also look around Flickr and such for CC licensed images but if you’ll be posting your work anywhere, those require crediting. morgueFile was made with artists in mind, as long as you modify the image you can do whatever you want with your work and that can be useful so you can just worry about doing your study and not whether you can share it later or you have to attach a giant list of credits.

I added a piece of paper so you can see the glass better.&nbsp;I plan on adding contact paper and painting the back gray.  Intro I think I’ve tried every kind of artist’s palette ever, but none have really worked for me. The best was the typical DIY stay-wet palette (a sponge/paper towels &amp; wax paper in an airtight box), but they all required me to remember to spray them with water every day, the paint would go runny in parts, and the wax paper would start to rip and in general felt weird under a palette knife. I tried a plastic sheet instead of wax paper, but the paint kept less and needed more spraying. I’ve also tried just using a glass palette (which feels great with a palette knife) and storing away the leftover paint in a little jar (where it mixes to a gray that can be reused), but the pallet had to be constantly spray it so everything was wet enough to scrap off later (dried bits were a nightmare). And I think it only kept in that relatively big little jar because I mixed in a lot of Golden Open medium. I was seriously considering switching to oils at one point unless I could find/make a palette that worked for me. My only idea was an improved version of the one I had (thinner, better seal, &amp; paint wells that sealed individually against the lid) but it would have been quite hard to make on my own. Then as I was searching around for more ideas I found this palette and I loved the idea of tiny individual containers, but what to use? Most jars I had where to big and all the other plastic containers I could think of were either square (like pill containers), probably not airtight, or had weird grooves (like my contacts cases). Then I saw a soda bottle and this palette was born. Plastic bottle caps are the perfect size, plus most of them come with a little seal and I didn’t have to buy anything. I tested them during a long painting session (for me, ~3 hours) and they were just perfect. They hold 5-7 ml depending on the cap btw. They’re technically not doing anything to keep the paint wet, but I can mix more paint than I think I’ll need, either in the bottle cap itself or on the glass palette. Anything that’s larger than a spoon-full keeps wet for an hour or so without spraying. Than anything left over is stored. I still use the plate of glass for smaller variations and mixes, but they tend to be small and temporary. If they dry, it doesn’t matter. It’s a thin layer and can be wiped off usually (if I’m using Open medium) or scraped off after the session. When I’m done painting for the day I just screw the tops back on and put everything away. No worrying that I have to use the paint within 2-3 weeks (which is around what the others lasted), adding an alarm to remind myself to spray them keep them wet, or having them go all gross and runny. They’ll probably keep indefinitely, but just in case I’m currently testing one to see how long the walls coated in paint (with the Open Medium) will stay wet (it’s still wet a week in). They’re also really easy to clean because they’re round. If you’re using clear bottles you can tell what color they are like that or you can label them on the tops/bottoms. Materials  Some are a different sizes.  Note the seals on both. Soda Bottles - Preferably clear bottles. Note that different sizes/brands will have slightly different sized caps. Also try to get the ones that have a seal on the inside. Plastic Glue Gun - I don’t think crazy glue would hold up well to the humidity (also it fogs clear plastic if you want the bottoms clear), but you could try. I tried model glue, but the paint would start to leak after a few hours. The glue gun worked the best. An alternative might be epoxy glue (update: tried, does not work well, it looks it does but comes off) or silicone. Plastic Sheet ~0.5mm - I used a piece of white HIPS plastic (Styrene) for model making. But you could use just about anything that you can cut with some scissors. I’d avoid too thin though if you can.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be hard&nbsp;to grasp and press to the cap before the glue cools, and when I got it quickly it got really hot and warped a bit. Update: I have since made a lot more of these, this time with thin flexible plastic. I had one of these past ones leak. The rest were fine, but the thinner plastic contours better to the rough edges. First I tried the type of plastic old VHS boxes came wrapped in, but that peeled off, so I bought some transparent flexible plastic they sell at the local hardware store, it's about 1mm thick. Seems to have worked better Something to Cut the Caps Off - You could just use a hand saw or a razor blade, but it’s a pain for more than a few bottle-caps. I tried. The plastic is quite thicker where it needs to be cut than the rest of the bottle. I ended just doing a batch of caps with an angle grinder. Razor Blade/X-Acto Knife - For trimming excess plastic. Scissors - To cut the bottom circles out of your plastic. This will probably dull your scissors so don’t use your good ones. Sandpaper - Not necessary if you got the cut nice and level. Making the Cap Containers Cut the Caps Off It’s best to get the cut as close as possible to the lip/edge, especially if you’ll be using a thinner glue. A thicker glue gives you more leeway. Also before you cut them, take the caps off. I made the mistake of cutting with them on and I had to wrestle some of the caps off. Somebody had shut them really tight. ##   Cleaning Up Trim any excess plastic with an razor blade. Sand them if necessary. If you used an angle grinder like I did, the plastic kind of melts and forms these weird layers (I don’t know if you can see one above on the last cap, like a little white triangle). Cut those off if you get them. Cut off the Safety Rings Or whatever those are called, so you can have a little window to see your paint colors. Be sure to store your bottle caps away from light unless you leave those rings on and you can’t see any paint at all. Cut the Bottom Circles Separate the caps by sizes and then trace your bottle-caps onto your chosen piece of plastic and cut them out. It’s easier with scissors (though it might dull them). Gluing Them Using hot glue I found it easiest to put a thick line of blue onto the cap, then press the plastic to it. If you mess up, just wait for the glue to dry, peal it off, and retry. Some glue will seep inside, but it shouldn’t be too much. Don’t try to fix it by melting it to the edge with the gun, it just makes more of a mess. They’re easier to clean if you just leave it alone. Any glue that’s seeped on the outside edge can be trimmed.  Finishing Touches I didn’t always place the plastic perfectly center so after I was finished I trimmed the entire bottom edge with a razor blade, then ran the hot glue gun over it to smooth it down (the hot glue tends to lift/stretch or rip instead of letting you cut through it). Final Result I’m using them lose now, just resting them on top or by my glass palette, but they could be glued to an existing palette. I’m considering making a line of them with just the main colors I use because I also find it easier to get paint out of them than out of the tube.  Another thing they come in handy for is keeping different medium mixes. You can dip the brush in and it doesn’t really matter if you contaminate such a small amount. Same thing with dipping into titanium white. I also have a partial time-lapse video of the first painting I tested them with. Unfortunately I couldn’t find a comfortable place to put the camera, you can’t see the palette, and I only filmed an hour or two. But you can see I’m mostly using the spray for the painting itself, the other times to dilute a glaze mix on the glass. I only sprayed the actual bottle caps the 2 times I stood up to get something and left them open. You get a fair bit of warning if the caps need spraying. The paint around the edges will start to thicken and dry first, but that can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, and the paint inside will still stay wet. You could not spray them at all and just peel off any dry paint around the edges at the end of a session.   As for my drying test, see the last bottle cap. That small amount of paint (with Open Medium) was still wet after a week, so I think that’s a huge success. Had I done that in any previous stay-wet palette it wouldn’t have lasted more than a day without spraying.","tags":["acrylics","art supplies","diy","tools/software"],"permalink":"/2015/10/bottle-cap-palette"},"/2015/09/wooden-chest":{"title":"Wooden Chest","contents":"In this post I'll be showing you how I made the wooden chest.  Cutting the Boards No matter how much you plan ahead, there’s going to be some discrepancies so I wouldn’t advice measuring, mark, and cut ALL the pieces at once. Before I cut I took some time to think it out first. I marked boards I was sure I needed cut. I also laid them out when possible to check they fit properly. With recycled wood this can be quite the problem because the boards are often curved to one side or have one face better than another. The extent you can take this planning is usually 1⁄2 or 3⁄4 of the building order. The rest I tentatively marked just to make effective use of the wood. I’ll be mentioning my measurements to help keep track and for my records, but most of them should just be ignored. The Bottom First I did the bottom 7 boards. They defined the bottom area of the chest (just more in reality). I chose their 65 cm length. But then the width needed to be measured. I settled on 28.5 cm, as the side were just slightly different. Now for the bottom I laid out the boards like this because it provides more strength. So I cut the 2 short outer boards at 28,5cm. Instead of using the confusing long/short terminology I used in my notes I’m going to use outer to mean boards that reach the end, and inner to mean boards that don’t.  Now the long inner boards depend on these two 28.5cm boards. So it’s 65cm - x, x being the width of the two short outer boards (not just multiplying one, but adding both and at both ends). For me that came out to 56.9cm (in this case the same, but for the sides some where a few millimeters off). The Sides I had already check that all the side’s heights would be pretty close. So I went ahead and cut the 65 cm boards for the front and back. The shorter sides depended on that first 28,5 cm measurement and the thickness of the front &amp; back boards which thankfully didn’t vary much. I got 26.5 cm. Next came the borders. I laid out all the sides side by side (there’s a tongue twister) and then decided on a height that would look good on them all. There was a bit of room for error, because unlike the bottom, I wanted all the other sides to have long outer border boards and short inner ones just because I thought it looked better.  I decided on 32cm in total. So this would be the height of the box. Note that you have to factor in the thickness of the bottom of the chest. This was so that instead of having to use 8 boards for the sides, I could use 7 because and between the thickness provided by the bottom boards and the space left for the lid they fit in just fine and I thought I was short for wood at the time.  But I couldn’t cut those short inner border boards just yet. First I had to cut the long outer boards. For the front and back these were 65 cm + 2x, x being the thickness of the boards. This gave me 67.3 cm. For the left/right sides this was just 28.5 cm like the bottom outer short border.  Here you can get an idea of how the corners fit. Now I could lay out all the borders and measure the short inner boards individually so that in total all the sides heights add up to 32 cm. They ended up 23-24 cm as shown in the first picture. The Lid I cut the final 7 boards for the top at 65 cm. The long outer borders at 67.3 cm. I left the short inner boards for after I put the chest together just to get a perfect fit. They ended up around 22.8 cm. Putting it all Together I used 9x20 (they’re in mm here) nails. Just short enough that they wouldn’t go through two boards. The Bottom To have zero nails visible on the outside, this is how I put them in on the bottom, with only slight variations of the method for the sides. Blue mean the nails are going in from the inside of the chest. Yellow means going in from the outside, they hold onto the sides. Then the orange ones are for just holding the boards to the bottom border, that’s why there’s fewer of them.  I kind of did these all at once. There was lots of camping, gluing and ungluing. I thought building it would be easier so I hadn’t thought it out as much. But even now looking back, to make the nails invisible like this I would have had to unglue one part at least once, and not using glue was impossible because the pieces would move around everywhere when I hammered them. The photo was taken a few steps later. In reality this first part just consisted of the bottom border, the bottom boards, and the bottom board for all the sides. The Left/Right Sides These have to be done first to be able to connect them to the front/back sides properly at the edges. First I glued the side boards to their respective borders, I started by putting up the bottom vertically and on the respective side because as you’ll remember I already attached the last board of all the sides. With some odd maneuvering, I nailed all the boards to the short inner borders. Here the blue are nails going from the inside to the short inner border boards of the outside and the green are going from the inside to the outside as well but connecting the long outer border.  The Front/Back Sides I messed up here as well. It would have been easier to first nail all 7 boards to the left/right sides with the nails indicated in yellow (going from the outside in) then attached the border with the nails indicated in blue and green (going from the inside to the outside).   The Top Border Boards I left these for last because it was very hard to properly attach the bottom borders all level. That meant some of the short inner borders that to be sanded until all the top border pieces were level. The Top I finally double checked the short inner sides and cut them. Next I loosely glued the border together. When the glue had set I glued the seven boards to it. As it set I turned the box over and checked that the lid would fit. I left it all like that with the box on top until the glue had dried. Once it was dry I nailed all the boards to the border and it was done. The Finished&nbsp;Chest  I haven’t applied varnish to it yet. I decided to just put it to use anyways because something came up and it might be a while before I can buy the varnish. I’m also unsure about whether I want hinges or if they’re even that possible given how I made it.  One’s man trash is another man’s trash. And here’s all the junk I put in it. It’s mostly just odd plastic parts/boxes/cases that are too big to fit anywhere else. For years I kept all this in like a huge paper bag I had. Then after a move three years ago they’ve been in two annoying cardboard boxes ever sense. I would have kept them there except it’s not so much that stuff is piled on top of each other and hard to get out (that’s always going to happen) but longer tubes and stuff didn’t fit and the smaller the space, the harder it is to use the space efficiently.","tags":["3d","3d model","diy","woodworking"],"permalink":"/2015/09/wooden-chest"},"/2015/09/converting-a-camera-tripod-into-an-easel":{"title":"Converting a Camera Tripod into an Easel","contents":"I’m poor and cheap so there's no way I would ever spend money on an art easel. I might make one someday, but I’ve never actually worked on one. I was just curious as to the experience, so yet another reason to not spend a bunch of money on something I might never use again. Plus I have an easel looking thing, what other reason do I need to mess with my tripod? Perhaps I shouldn’t say that. No tripods were harmed in this process.  Now this won’t work with all tripods. It depends on how the mount works, but the basic idea should work for most. I was about to try to find a hex nut at the right size (it seems to be 1⁄2”-20 for DSLRs but don’t quote me on that), but this was just easier. Here’s what my mount looks like btw: Tripod Mount SideTripod Mount BackTripod Mount So basically all I had to do was cut a piece of wood at the proper angle. I measured the tripod’s mount first to get the dimensions of the triangle at the sides, then because although I still have SohCahToa stuck in my head, I don’t like to think so I just plugged in the two measurements and a 90 degree angle into the triangle calculator. I got around 63°. That meant I had to put the saw at a 27° angle. The piece of MDF I found laying around to use was slightly taller than the mount. This doesn’t really matter. It just makes it a bit harder to determine the proper size. So I started with a slightly bigger cut then kept cutting until I got the right size +/- 2mm. Be careful with your fingers, the piece is very small! I could probably have mathed out the distance between the sides better, but this took less time. Once I got two opposite side fitting about right. I could also just use that for the other because my mount happens to be perfectly square. I technically didn’t need to angle all the sides. The mount’s sides are all angles so you can change the way you orient the camera (when you flip it 90°), but there’s only one angled side on the actual tripod and then the little latch that hooks in is angled as well. But well I did it anyways just in case. After all the angles where cut as close as possible I trimmed the edges with a razor plade to make it fit. If you don’t have a saw you can probably get away with doing this entire part with a handsaw or a razor blade. MDF is quite easy to cut although it feathers a bit, but for this it doesn’t matter. Easel Attachment - BackEasel Attachment - SideEasel Attachment - Top Then for the part that actually holds the canvas/board+paper, I didn’t want to do anything too complex because I don’t know how much I’ll like it yet. I got the same piece of MDF that was lying around and cut it into three pieces. 2 x 2cm, and a long piece around 30cm which was left over. Then I just glued everything together. I don’t work on particularly large or heavy panels so I’m not too worried about it falling apart. If it does a few nails should hold it together. Also I’m a bit unsure just how big the gap should be, so if it’s too small/big I can just tear it apart and change the size real quick.  Easel Attachment - Ledge And here are some pictures of the finished easel mount on my tripod.It’s a rough proof of concept. If I like it I’ll probably make a nicer one later. Tripod EaselTripod Easel - CloseupTripod Easel with MDF BoardTripod Easel with MDF Board - Side The white board is just a thin piece of MDF I use as a smooth drawing surface for paper drawing/watercolors.

This post is outdated.  I love highlighting in books, makes finding favorite passages easier. But I also do a lot of research so I need that feature. Unfortunately there aren’t that many devices/apps capable of syncing and exporting highlights. I don’t know why not. One would think this would be a really obvious feature in any app that allows hghlighting. Apparently not. For example, the only way I can really get highlights from a PDF is by going through Goodreader. Acrobat can’t do this! And for ebooks, the Kindle can’t do this either! I don’t know why. It’s ridiculous. That, not being able to access personal docs on the Windows Kindle app, and the fact that you can’t scroll in the Kindle app have always made me want to ditch it, but no other app can sync with my Kindle… sigh. I’ve considered getting a different ereader brand next time (the Keyboard is seriously outdated at this point) but none have good sync options. Technically with Amazon you can sort of export highlights if you bought the books from them (it’s easy to access them in a way that lets you copy), but not your personal documents. If you try to search for how to do this most of the guides are about this method which is useless for personal documents. There is a way to export your personal document highlights from your kindle itself and I’ll go over it quickly, but I don’t know if it works with newer kindles. The new method I found is as far as I know almost undocumented and will work from any iOS device, possibly even Android. From Your Kindle There is of course the Clippings.txt but this file is ONLY updated if you make a highlight from your kindle, which makes it useless if you read anywhere else as well. It’s also a mess going through it. The better method is getting them from the .MBP files in your Kindle. Highlights are stored inside these alongside your books with each file corresponding to a book. You can copy them over to your computer and then use this little program, MBP Reader, (place it in the same folder as your highlights) to extract them. Just double-click and it’ll create a bunch of txt files containing the highlights for each book. Now according to the people that created the MBP reader, Amazon changed the file type in response to this. Why???!!! and no before you ask you can’t copy an entire book like this, there’s a clipping limit still in place. But on my Kindle Keyboard this still works. Maybe they only did this on the newer ones? I don’t know. But this is one way to get your highlights. And for the most part I’d do it this way if you can because it’s slightly easier and the clipping limit, although still there, is larger. You’ll know if you hit it because the text file will just have a number and no highlights. From Your iPad/iPhone (possibly Android as well) NOTE: This has a clipping limit. In fact the clipping is smaller than what’s even shown on the notes summary screen of the iPad. It seems like it’s 50 words like the copyright limit (that’s about 3 lines in the iPad notes summary screen). Getting your clippings from the .MBP files allows for quite a bit more, hence why I prefer it. There are times when using the first method is impossible though. For example, I recently wanted to read a very large book (it had lots of images) on my iPad. It was a .mobi and making it into a PDF ruined the formatting. You can’t email a book over 25mb to your Kindle address because of Gmail’s file limit. I’ve tried different email services that claimed to be able to send big files (if anybody knows one that works, leave a link), but eventually I gave up and manually transferred the book through iTunes onto the Kindle app. The thing is this won’t sync the highlights so even if I put the book in my Kindle Keyboard the .MBP file won’t be generated. I thought well, come to worse, I would just use the fool proof third method described below, but I really didn’t want to by the time I’d read the book because I’d highlighted a lot of stuff. I searched around and apparently according to this Stack Exchange question the Kindle App used to keep an SQlite file called AnnotationStorage. This is literally the only place I’ve ever seen a proper answer to this problem and it’s not even the first answer. Also the average user probably has no idea what an SQL Database even is and nobody else seems to have bothered to detail the process. So I thought I’d do it. Instructions Step 1 Okay first we’ll need to get the files. You’ll need some way to access your iPad/iPhone device’s internal files. This is a piece of cake if you’re jailbroken (iFile). If you’re not there’s supposedly desktop applications that do allow you to see App folder but I haven’t tried them (the Stack Exchange answer mentions iFunBox Classic). Step 2 Depending on your iOS version the Applications folder will be in different places. Now I imagine this file probably also exists on Android, but I don’t have an android device to try. If anybody knows, leave a comment.  Pre iOS8 in /private/var/mobile/Applications and it’s easy to find the Kindle folder. Post iOS8 it’s a nightmare. You’ll have to go to /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application and then you’ll see a bunch of folders with different numbers. I believe this number changes occasionally. You could still attempt to bookmark it though, but it’s likely you’re going to have to do this every single time. It might be easier to just know the approximate size of the folder. You’re going to have to go one by one and open then go into the folders to determine which is the Kindle app.If you’ve manually transferred a book it’s easier to check the APPNUMBER/Documents/ of each app as you’ll immediately see the .MOBI for your book there. Otherwise check all APPNUMBER/Library folders, the Kindle one should contain folders named ACX, AmazonADs, etc. and the AnnotationStorage will be there.  Step 3 Now if you’re not there already navigate to /Library in the Kindle folder. Here like I said you’ll find the AnnotationStorage file (ignore the other AnnotationStorage -smh and -wal files). With iFile you can just select it, zip it, and email it to yourself to get it on your computer. Or you can use an app or SSH, but get it onto your computer somehow. Step 4 Now you’ll need an SQLite reader. There are many (the Stack Exchange answer mentioned DBBrowser) I used a firefox Add-on called SQLite Manager because I already had it and the search function is better. DB Browser doesn’t seem to be able to search for fragments of a cell. Step 5 Rename the file to AnnotationStorage.sqlite. Step 6 Open it with whatever program you want. You’re going to want to go to Tables > ZANNOTATION and switch the view so you can see the table. In SQLite Manager that’s just the Browse &amp; Search tab. It’s going to look kind of like an Excel sheet. The important columns are ZRAWBOOKID. If you sort by this, you’ll sort by book. If you can’t find your book you can search ZUSERTEXT for a phrase in a highlight then get the book ID from that highlight and search by the book ID. Another important column is ZRAWANNOTATIONTYPE if you just want to get your notes or something. Step 7 To export the data you need to highlight the rows you want then Right Click > Copy as CVS (MSExcel Compatible). Or you can run an SQL Query to get just the columns you want then copy from that. In SQLite Manager just go to Execute SQL, paste your preferred query and hit Run SQL. Make sure there’s at least a space between each line or format it as shown. Either should work. Here’s a basic query that will get everything and order it by book then the location.

I had heard about magic lantern but I was too afraid to break something so I never got it and eventually forgot about it. Lately though I’ve been wanting to push the limits on my camera It’s been broken in, I know more about photography, and I’ve finally gotten some vital accessories like a tripod and a remote control. I really like macro photography and I’m also interested in doing small stop motion animations with the ship models I plan to build so I was looking up ways to increase the depth of field (increasing the depth of field is what makes them not look like miniatures). I’d come up with the idea of taking several pictures at different focuses (focus stacking, though I didn’t know this was an actual thing that had a name) but that hadn’t worked well without a tripod. Now that I had a tripod I thought I’d test it again. It worked better, but there was no way to adjust it the same every single time the way I needed. My mind was already working away in the background suggesting all kinds of complex jigs, when I finally thought I should probably do a Google search to see if this is possible with the Canon software that lets you control the camera from your computer. It’s not, but apparently there were other programs that could do this very thing. Well I searched around some more because I was also interested in finding if there was some way to improve the video (there isn’t, or at least it’s not noticeable), and magic lantern came up. Turns out it had a focus stacking feature. It was also much easier to install than I anticipated.  Installing First check if your model is supported and what is supported, for example Audio Controls are not supported on mine. :( You can find the ML builds here. Be sure to get a non-failed one. If the nightly build failed on your model like mine, click Show Older Builds, then scroll down and find one that doesn’t say (failed). Instructions on how to install it are here. Read the warnings and check your current firmware is the right one. The instructions are pretty clear, if they’re not there’s plenty of videos out there detailing the process. Once you have it installed it can be a bit glitchy and confusing, but even thought it couldn’t do much about the video in my case, some of the other things it can do are incredibly useful. It’s to the point that I don’t get why Canon doesn’t program some of this stuff in. Anyways, here are some of my favorite ML features. You can find the documentation on them in the User Guide.&nbsp;I’ve linked each of my headings to theirs to make it easier. Focus Stacking What I was looking for in the first place. It’s really simple.You focus, choose how many pictures in front and behind, the steps between each picture, and that’s it. There’s also more advanced options like setting it to the rack focus range. Usually 2-3 is enough to bring something the size of a small model into focus. Also if it isn’t obvious, since this works by controlling the focus ring in the lens, the camera needs to be connected to the lens with AF on, so in any instance when you don’t have that connection, you also can’t photo stack, in my case, I have one of those cheap macro extension tubes that you screw on, so any macro shots done with those still need to be focus stacked manually. It’s not much of a problem though because unlike the stop motion situation, I don’t need to repeat the same maneuver perfectly every time, it’s just one picture I’m usually trying to get. Magic Lantern also has Focus Peak,which makes this type of manual focusing ten times easier. Combining these in Photoshop For some reason File &gt; Automate &gt; Photomerge does not have a Stack Focus option. It’s supposed to be the equivalent of the following menus/actions: File &gt; Scripts &gt; Load Files in Stack, Edit &gt; Auto-Align Layers, and Edit &gt; Auto-Blend Layers but the blend option doesn’t really make a difference. It’s like it wants to do a Panorama blend but there’s no way to change this like there is in the Auto-Blend Layers menu. You have to turn the blend option off (else you get layer masks) when you import your pictures with Photomerge, then select all the layers and go to Edit &gt; Auto-Blend Layers manually and choose Stack Images instead of panorama. Also check Seamless Tones and Colors if the light changes significantly between each picture (you should try to avoid this), if not, leave it unchecked. This could all be made into an action probably. If I get around to it, I’ll upload the individual action. Example Here’s is an example picture I did of a little red London bus I have. It’s 8cm long. It isn’t to any specific scale because it’s supposed to be a pencil sharpener (it can’t hold the shaving but this one at least works, I have a similar phone box which you can’t use because you can’t get the shavings out!). Fixing DOF without Focus Stacking Now with something this big and no background you can just solve the DOF issue by using a really small aperture (high F-stop) and really slow shutter speed to compensate for the low light coming in. Here are two separate examples and a zoomed in section for comparison. f/16s, 6sf/29s, 30s  Left:f/16s, 6s | Right: f/29s, 30s I’ve only done some small color correction because the left one came out slightly darker (I should have exposed it for longer). As you can see there’s still some fuzziness near the back on the left one but not very much, and on the right it’s completely gone. Had I had a background though, this wouldn’t have been the case with the background. So if I had wanted to put two models into focus, this wouldn’t have worked (I unfortunately don’t have the space to demonstrate this at the moment). Fixing DOF with Focus Stacking First some closeups of the seven pictures I took. These in comparison where taken at f/6.3 (to make my life slightly easier), and 1s. You can clearly see the depth of field slowly changing. Stack Step 1Stack Step 2Stack Step 3Stack Step 4Stack Step 5Stack Step 6Stack Step 7 And here they are all merged by Photoshop. Now I chose the bus because it’s a good example of an object Photoshop isn’t that good at merging.  Merged with Photoshop You’ll notice the windows and some of the highlights in the front look a bit odd. If you want it to look better you either have to give photoshop more data, so more pictures, better pictures (higher F-Stop), or you have to merge it by hand. At this size, like I said, you can just increase the F-Stop and with 2-3 pictures you’ll be good, but if this were a tiny flower you might need as many as I did here and depending on how many closely overlapping sections of focus (the windows) you have, even more unless you want to do it by hand.  Merged by Hand Here’s the picture merged by hand for comparison. Note I said merged, not fixed. The way Photoshop creates the masks makes it very confusing to try to fix the merge it creates. I recommend aligning the layers in Photomerge but not blending them, then going from back to front, with the back one without a mask, then adding masks, setting them to black, painting in anything that is more in focus, and “erasing”/masking out anything that isn’t. Rinse and repeat until you reach the front. Be careful that the front of the object isn’t always in “front” layer. In the bus for example, only the corner is in the front layer, the left side isn’t. I’d actually recommend not taking more pictures and trying to do it by hand just to save shutter actuations if you plan on doing this a lot, especially if it’s just a single shot you want to capture. Sometimes you might not be able to get the subject to stay still enough for so many photos either (this can also affect how high of an F-Stop you can go to). It only takes 10-15 minutes to fix, even less with a tablet. The one picture scenario is usually my case for something tiny enough to need so many pictures. Any stop motion I’m planning is at this scale or larger. Plus with stop motion since each picture is a frame it’s unlikely people will notice the tiny mistakes Photoshop makes so it doesn’t really matter. Consistent merging will look better than inconsistent merging by hand. Focus Peak/Zebra Luma Focus Peak lets you see areas of focus on the screen as tiny colored dots so you don’t have to be using the digital zoom to check things are in the best focus. It’s incredibly useful, specially with macro photography where I’m usually resting the camera in really odd positions that make it impossible to properly see the screen. With a glance I can check the dots are in the right place. It also has an option to display overexposed areas with those zebra stripes.  [](http://wiki.magiclantern.fm/_media/beertje6.jpg)Image by Magic Lantern/used under CC-BY-SA Trap Focus I haven’t really put this one to much testing, but it seems like something I’ll be using a lot. Basically when the image comes into focus, it snaps a picture. Just turning it on though, it snaps the moment anything comes into focus so you have to change the AF point. ML also seems to provide some way to use custom focus patterns, but I haven’t tried it. The one big problem with this feature is that it bugs out. It might just be me, but even though I have it set to hold AF + half shutter, half the time I have to go back into ML’s menu than out to get it to work again. FPS Override This is my favorite though, because I wasn’t expecting it the use I found for it. I was more interested to see how much the frame rate could be increased. Turns out not much. 35 is hardly an noticeable over the 30 fps it could do before, and you can’t get audio with FPS Override on. But doing the opposite, that is setting the frame rate really low, solved a different long time problem I’ve had. Before if I wanted to record a video, first I’d have to do it in 30 minute increments, and second, it would just eat my battery and really heat up my camera. I mainly wanted to record time-lapses of me drawing, so all that mess just to later speed the footage up and drop 1⁄8 of the frames. I knew Magic Lantern could solve the time/size limitation with automatic restart, but what I didn’t realize was that by setting the frame rate really low it would solve everything. I tested a video outside in the shade at 2 FPS (1 FPS seemed to have a problem where it would take too long to stop the video recording, I don’t know why). The camera lasted 3 hours, by the end of which it still had a bit of battery left, and it didn’t heat up nearly as much. Then there’s the added bonus that everything is already sped up for me when I play it back. I barely have to edit any video before uploading it. I’ll be trying it out on some sketches soon. Other Updates  I was going to do the post about my chest but there were some delays. I’d glued on one of the front borders slight off and when I tried separating the boards they broke completely. This had happened plenty of times and the boards had separated just fine after some hammering and plying, but apparently this time the glue had really sunk in or something. It was like trying to separate two thin lego. I did have plenty of leftover boards, but they were all the moldy ones and this was the front so I had to get yet another board. I cut it in half length wise already which is the most problematic part because the table saw is a pain to move outside. So now I just need to sand it and cut it too length which I will probably end up doing with a hand saw out of sheer laziness. I found a place that sells relatively cheap thin (less than 1mm) HIPS plastic in small quantities so I’ll finally be getting some. No more scavenging for plastic.

I’ve tried several times, unsuccessfully, to keep some sort of blog or social media account, but I never quite got the hang of it. I also didn’t have enough energy at the time to keep up with one because of some medical issues, but lately I’ve improved and wanted to start up again. I also started keeping a sort of log notebook. Keeping a journal never did it for me, but sometimes it’s hard to do something just because (e.g. sketches just for practice that will never be seen) and then have nothing to show for it. It created the strange illusion that even though I was feeling better, I hadn’t gotten anything done, when in fact I just went through a series of “invisible” (e.g. learning how to program, etc.) and/or failed projects. So I dug out this old Moleskine I’d never truly found a use. For years I couldn’t get myself to use it. I finally decided to hell with it and started using it almost a year ago to record ideas when I went out, but it’s sat mostly unfilled. But anyways I took it and just started to write down everything I did each day. It’s been two months, which is dozens of times longer than I’ve managed to stay with any other sort of journal like thing, and it’s evolved quite nicely. I’ve added a small to-do list in the back and there’s a series of symbols so I can also write down notes, ideas, and supply places/prices. The last one might sound kind of strange, but it serves two purposes. First, where I live there’s super high inflation and it’s very hard to find art related supplies. Just in the time I’ve started using the thing for notes which is less than a year, there’s evidence in there of colored pencil prices doubling. Second, some of the names for materials/tools are very different, they might go by the technical name, by a brand specific to my country, or the translation might just seem illogical to me, and in a lot of places, everything is behind the counter, something which I wasn’t used to, so you have to know what to ask for.  Point is I want to do something similar with the blog, hence the name, and then at most set up a youtube to post some videos to accompany it (maybe some tutorials, I used to do those, but they’re a pain to record and edit). Unlike my personal-everything-goes log though, it will be more focused, so to speak. I can’t believe I didn’t make the connection earlier, but I realized maybe I should approach blogging in the same way I realized years ago I should approach my writing (novels): imagining my audience as being the reader side of me, like the alternate universe version of me that was never a writer (it can’t be just me me or there’d be very little criteria for what to keep/cut since I would enjoy the story regardless), and that’s it. No feedback unless I’m nearly finished or I’m really stuck. No leaving things in or cutting things out because I feel x person might like it more/less. It really helped with pinning down what I wanted with my writing so I thought why not do the same with my blog? I’ll only post mostly-finished or need-to-be-finished things, the sort of things I like to read about, and write and share them the way I like to see them shared. My RSS feed of art/diy blogs is huge and the more detail oriented the better. I love medium length articles. In this day and age people tend to want the quick version of things, but I feel trying to satisfy that would be compromising too much. In the end, I’d rather a few readers that actually read and enjoy the same style blogs I do, then hundreds that don’t. I’m also very much a perfectionist and much like with my writing in the beginning, with blogs and such I had the problem where I’d post WIPs, put them on hold, look back, especially at drawing WIPs, and think they looked awful and so quit on them. On the one hand it can be nice to see your progress (mostly my experience has been to cringe though), but on the other hand sometimes doing stuff that will never get seen and will just get deleted or thrown away at the end takes off any pressure to not fail, and the failing is going to happen, it needs to happen, and it’s much nicer and easier to let go and fail in a controlled environment without pressure. Basically doing it for the sake of doing it and learning to enjoy that process regardless of the outcome really really helps in my case (apart from creating a habit, which is the other half of the equation). The log helps fix the lack of a good progress record that doing this creates, but I’ve also found there aren’t as many gaps as I expected. Since I’ve been doing more things, there’s a higher output and therefore more things that meet my expectations, and not just that, but when I’m finished I find myself caring less about any mistakes I find later because since I designated the project as practice, the result almost always exceeds my zero expectations. Later on once I’ve mastered the basics, high attention to detail can really help my works, and that’s probably why I was never too keen to let that side of me go, but usually that’s definitely not the case at the beginning, and it just becomes a fruitless attempt to satisfy the perfectionist in me. I know I can’t possibly expect to do something to my satisfaction on the first try (though it often exceeds others’ expectations which just seems to frustrate me more), but getting my brain to not freak out has always been a problem. And it was never helped by the fact that I’d take on projects I couldn’t possibly hope to master the skills I needed to complete them for months or years to come. Doing the above has forced me to start with smaller projects. For example, I’d been wanting to get back into 3D modeling again for a while, but I wasn’t sure about what program to go with. I had worked with Autodesk 3Ds Max and Architecture before and was leaning towards Autodesk programs. They have a free 3 year student version that might as well be unlimited given they release a new version every year. I actually did get 3ds Max, but I must have has a better mouse back when I first tried it because I just couldn’t stand the middle mouse for panning and didn’t like the other arrangements it offered. Then of course there’s Blender which is completely free, but I remembered it being horribly confusing and uncomfortable so although that’s where I’ll probably end up in the end, I didn’t want to start with it because I was sure it would crush my returning interest. Then a friend recommended C4D, even let me try it on their computer. It costs and arm and a leg and unfortunately only technically has a 45 day trial (with saving, unlimited without). I should seriously make a chart. But anyways C4D was amazing. way easier to understand than anything I’d ever tried, I could get it much closer to my ideal shortcut layout, and its interface is one of the most intuitive and customizable I’ve ever seen. But I digress, onto my point. Before, I would have wanted to start with something like a short (at least I knew better than to aim for a movie) or model/rig an entire character in full detail as the first project (I know, insane). I had actually done a realistic 3d head, but that was in Sculptris (free) which had maybe a 1 day learning curve, and even then that took 100+ hours. So, this time I didn’t even attempt to animate anything or do anything larger than a head in terms of detail. I chose something relatively simple, but that would keep my interest, and that was an Iron Man helmet. Not too detailed, not exact (although that was kind of decided for me when I couldn’t find good orthographic views). Only the mouth piece moves. The back is kind of iffy. I didn’t know and still don’t know how to texture remotely well or do lights. But what I did learn which had until then mystified me, was point modeling (not starting with a shape). I also got really familiar with the modeling tools much quicker than I would have had I attempted something that involved more than modeling, part of that was using C4D, but most of it was choosing something simple to work on. And once I was familiar with which tools I used the most (took about a day) I dedicated some time to tweaking the interface and mapping the shortcuts to my left hand. Something which I found with Photoshop improved my workflow at least 25% for most things, and probably 50% for tasks that involve a lot of switching between tools/panels. I now hardly have any panels open, just a canvas, options bar, and tool bar (because there isn’t another way to keep track of fg/bg colors). I switch between most things with shortcuts. Doing this early on in C4D allowed me to improve even faster after that first day and let me focus on learning 3D modeling techniques. I delete ALL the default shortcuts by the way, so that in case I forget what’s what, I can just press keys until I get the correct tool without accidentally pressing some obscure commands. It can then take a few weeks/months to truly finalize a layout (and consequently learn a program), editing it when anything gets uncomfortable, but it’s really worth it, even if you’ll just be using a program for a month. You can always save the config even if it’s a trial. I wouldn’t bother if it’s less time, you won’t be using it intensively, you didn’t like the program, or if it’s really really hard to set them (unless you need to use it for a long time), but otherwise it’s really worth it. I’ll make a post about the process when I get around to doing this for Blender. Iron Man Helmet - Front - Jaw OpenIron Man Helmet - FrontIron Man Helmet - Side - Jaw Open The helmet took 3-4 days, so about 30 hours of work, with various attempts at each part, not because they weren’t perfect, but more because I realized the way I approached them was wrong. When that happened, I’d just delete and restart. Had it been something else with more similar parts I might have just skipped some, but each part of the mask was an exercise in something completely different (e.g. face needed to have eyes but I needed to keep with the good habit of few triangles, the jaw needed that extruded edge that merged in later, the back needed to be shaped around that circle, and also layered in 3 parts, and then it all needed to fit/seal correctly). If I got tired of the mask, I could have just left it and moved on. Strangely enough I “finished” it. Just a few weeks later I can now see even more things I would have approached differently, but I’ve stopped seeing those things as mistakes or wanting to go back and fix it. For practice, it was great practice and really fun.  Wooden Chest 3D Model After that I did a chest. This is a real wooden chest I’m making btw. My dad got a bunch of old dirty wooden boards (the type that make up roofs) and I’ve been wanting to make a wooden chest for a long time. For any furniture I’ve always preferred to model stuff out instead of doing it on paper. It also offered the perfect chance to learn more about C4D’s awesome system of Mograph tools. (I’m talking about the booles, cloner, array, etc). I was semi-familiar with them, but I’ve now gotten to know all their settings, the best way to go about cloning things, how to combine objects (which had really confused me before), etc. Cloning especially made it really easy to change the size of the chest as needed. I only had a certain number of boards for me and I needed to plan it so I had enough. I couldn’t take the measurements completely from the model only because the boards weren’t perfect and some ended up a few millimeters longer than others when I cut them thinner. I still had to start from the bottom, mark, cut, then make my way up, measuring as I go for certain boards, but the model made it much easier to plan and visualize. There was also the problem at first that even though I cleaned and sanded the boards, some still had some mold stains, but only on one part of the board (less than half), which meant if I planned right, those could all go on the bottom. In the end I planned it so well I had quite a few left over boards so I redid all the moldy ones and left those for a different project. I’m thinking of making a rotational caster (I’m thinking similar to this one) with them, there’s more than enough for one, but not for something like another box.  Used Wooden Boards These are the other boards that my dad’s going to be making some sort of bench out of later. This is what mine looked like before. As you can see they were stained on one side (darker than it looks), but both sides needed sanding anyways because even the non-moldy ones were dirty/rough. They were also too wide, and still have those interlocking sides. And then below is how bad the mold looked on most of the bad boards, some were even worse.  Wooden Boards - Mold Growth Example And here are mine after, interlocking edges trimmed, cut in half along their length, sanded on both sides and the edges with 60 grit sandpaper (I didn’t like how the sharp edges looked against each other).  Wooden Boards - Cut and Sanded Below is one of the moldy ones (which I ended up redoing) which I also cleaned with some bleach. You can hardly tell in the picture (ignore the yellow tone btw, it was just in different light) but next to the clean ones or side by side with the rest of the moldy ones it was very obvious. They were okay for doing the bottom which wouldn’t be seen, or as I’m now planning, something like the rotational caster which doesn’t need to be pretty.  Wooden Boards - Bad Boards I just finished cutting them all today. Once I put all the pieces together I’ll do a post on it. Back to 3d modeling. I also tried to do an X-Wing. That one didn’t go well, but only because the orthographic images I found (from the Star Wars Vehicles book) are just ever so slightly off. So I either have to fix them, or even better, draw it up myself from scratch from reference images, so I think I’ll leave it for later since I also want to scratch build it from plastic. I can just make one set of drawings for both those things. Since I still wanted to practice doing a ship though, I tried coming up with one from scratch instead. I messed around with a few designs. Still haven’t got anything good, but I’m taking the chance to learn how to make materials and mess with the render settings which are really what make a model come to life. The actual modeling part is only half the battle. In the meantime I set up another reality based model. Like I said in the beginning I’m basically setting up the room I moved to from scratch. I have a desk, a few Andy drawers, and a bookcase, but everything else is in boxes and it’s just a mess. I used to have two desks, the Andy drawers, and one of those giant Ikea things with cubes where I put my collection of things and books. Now most of my things are in the attic. It’s been a while since the move that landed them there because of space issues so I’d really like to display everything again. Best way to test out configurations was a 3D model, so I measured the entire room and modeled it and the basic starting furniture. I got the configuration mostly down, but there’s still some details that I’m not sure about. I got some pretty cool ideas though, design wise. Plus it seems I will be sticking to one desk for various reasons, so I made a bunch of modifications to make better use of the space while keeping it clean and having everything on hand (which are the main problems for me with just having one desk). I think it’s better to wait until they’re finally implemented though, maybe do a video. So that’s 2 things I “finished” out of 5 in two months which is quite a lot for me, even compared to the times I felt semi-well health wise a few years back. And that’s just the 3d models, it’s not counting other things I’ve been doing that I haven’t mentioned. Anyways, I’ll try to post on a weekly basis. That’s my goal for now. Next time I might split the post along the week though since I tend to write a lot and my upcoming projects will have more details. Not as in more writing (this was more of an introductory post), but more instructions/pictures. It takes too much space to record how I went about a project on my personal log. Usually I’d save my messy notes to my computer, which are later a pain to decipher, so I might clean those up for the blog and use it as a log in that sense as well. I thought about using instructables which I love, but that would be yet another site to manage. Maybe I’ll write posts there first, we’ll see.","tags":["3d","3d model","diy","fanart","woodworking"],"permalink":"/2015/07/my-ideas-for-the-blog-and-current-projects"},"/2015/07/random-building":{"title":"Random Building","contents":"I take my notebook everywhere, mostly for writing, but occasionally there will a nice view from wherever I’m waiting.","tags":["artwork","ink/marker"],"permalink":"/2015/07/random-building"},"/2015/07/random-head":{"title":"Random Head","contents":"I was fooling around with MyPaint and this just sort of happened.
