<p>So this was just a test recording to see how well I could record me sculpting and it didn't turn out too well but I didn't want to just delete all this footage and the video I had planned got delayed for various reasons so I thought I'd post this anyway.</p>

<p>I really like painting and drawing buildings so two of the reference photos I had printed are castles. This one is Highclere Castle which most of you will probably recognize from Downton Abbey&nbsp;from Downton Abbey. It's on my ever growing list of places to go see. &nbsp;If it looks amazing in photos I can't imagine in real life.</p>

<p>I did a lot of research several tests before trying the techniques I tried here. And the painting seems to be stable for now, but <strong>I can’t guarantee anything, please do your own tests with your own materials and draw your own conclusions.</strong> Usually if there are problems it tends to happen within the first few days. As of now (two weeks), the painting is stable enough. The paint has not cracked or peeled (not even from purposely trying to peel it with tape), and the plastic (it’s HIPS plastic) is in great condition (the medium heat from the blow dryer did not bend it out of shape). Update: I did do a swab test (softly rubbing a wet cotton swab on the surface) at two weeks and I did get some very minor lifting in the background, but still nothing with the tape and nothing where I then painted the light in with gray over that red background. So I don’t think it’s something to worry about as long as I add an isolation layer of pure medium over everything. Whatever lose pigments remain from the under-bound paint look like they’re easily contained by another proper layer of paint. Overall it satisfies me. I’ll report back further once I add this layer.The only thing is I painted all the way to the edge and the paint is kind of ragged there, liable to being accidentally peeled from handling roughly. Before I didn’t paint to the edges because I used the edges to handle the canvas paper. I kept doing that for a while even though I started to secure my pages because they were already marked for it. But for this I thought there was no point, well now I realize it’s probably better to continue that habit.</p>
<p>Also all the water made the plastic stick to the paper I was using to hang it from. I managed to unstick it and rub it off with just some water, but some of the gesso came off. I repainted it, and it’s all fine. Not really the fault of the plastic (just the sheer amount of water would have ruined a painting in canvas paper), but more bad planning on my part.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the video I ended up using the painting to test some glazing techniques. You can see it's been divided into three sections. These were all done after the painting as touch dry. From left to right, my notes were as follows. Not the most precise, but they were meant as more of a starting point.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>One part titanium white to 3-4 parts liquin. Can be wiped nearly clean (compared to 3). Canvas texture smoother (compared to 3)</p></li>
<li><p>A bit of titanium white, couple drops of turps, and a bit of liquin, mixed to kind of a milky consistency. Tends to really sink into the canvas but smoothes fine with a brush, and ended up with the least texture. Can be wiped nearly clean (compared to 3).</p></li>
<li><p>Pure titanium white. Doing it with just a brush was impossible (might be possible with zinc white) so I used my thumb and that also helped reduce the canvas texture. And afterwards I wiped away the excess paint with a rag but it's hard to wipe away completely.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid using turps I think the best solution would be to just prime and sand the canvas smooth so that paint doesn't get stuck in the canvas texture. With that even pure titanium white could probably be laid very thinly.</p>]]></content>

<p>Their are way more limited palettes then what I covered. These are just the ones I wanted to try. Technically their are as many combinations of three colors as you could think of although only a couple dozen are very useful and common. You could even use a two color palette to great effect. James Gourney has some great examples of two palette paintings, <a href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com.ar/2015/07/experiments-with-limited-palette.html">this one I think is one of the most striking</a>. The Zorn palette is technically two color, but I see it more as a three color palette because the black serves as a substitute blue.</p>
<p>I also want to mention if you didn’t see the annotation I made, that it’s often much cheaper to buy a set if you can.</p>
<p>There’s also a lot of small sets to choose from, but for example with Golden, the small ones are around $0.16 per ml, while the big sets are only $0.11 per ml. Prices calculated from Amazon/Dick Blick.</p>
<p>There’s also different series/pigment prices to consider but the video was long enough. I’ll make a note to do a video on deciphering paint tubes.</p>

<p>The pencils I use are Lyra ArtDesign if you’re interested. I found them the smoothest of the ones I tried.</p>
<p>The eraser pencil is from Faber-Castel but to be honest if other brands exist I’d try those instead. I find the Faber-Castel one a bit too harsh and yet not hard enough to really keep a sharp tip. It feels and looks similar to a pink school eraser. I’ve not had mine stain that I can remember but there have been reviews complaining about that.</p>
<p>The book I mentioned is called Course in Pencil Sketching by Ernest Watson. I’ve mentioned it briefly before <a href="http://alansartlog.com/2016/01/two-landscapes">here</a> and <a href="http://alansartlog.com/2016/02/first-sketch-from-a-course-in-pencil-sketching">here</a>.</p>]]></content>

<p>Please note that this method is accurate so far as I’ve been able to compare it with 3d models, and also this was one of the methods used in a book I was reading, but as cover in the next video below there’s something off about using this to construct perfect cubes so I’m not sure if there might be some minor error or there’s something I’m not taking into consideration when constructing perfect cubes.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The image is just the thumb. I'm not scanning 100 pages. I go through them all in the video.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pqoqua2Vj8s?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>For the references I used a mix of <a href="http://artists.pixelovely.com/practice-tools/figure-drawing/">pixelovely</a>, <a href="http://www.quickposes.com/gestures/timed">quickposes</a>, and <a href="http://www.characterdesigns.com/">characterdesigns</a>, hence why unfortunately I did not have very early poses that repeat later. I have saved a few of my favorite poses for next time so hopefully there will be more to compare.</p>
<p>The anatomy book I like to use is Classic Human Anatomy by Valerie L. Winslow. If you can only afford one book get this one. The only downside is it's all drawn but I have found no other book so well done.</p>
<p>As for Michael Hampton who I mentioned, he has a wonderful <a href="http://www.figuredrawing.info/">blog</a> full of sketches that I found very helpful. He often shows his reference and I recommend you first attempt to do the pose from the reference, then look at his approach for help/comparison. He also has a book (Figure Drawing - Design and Invention) that looks very good.</p>
<p>The lightning bold figure drawing method I mentioned can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBq7rtnES0A">here</a>.</p>
<p>Oh also, this is kind of unrelated, but I fixed the noise on my microphone! I'm using an iPhone with a mic app plugged into my computer and I thought the noise was just a side-effect of the cable or being so close to my fan, but turns out it was all Windows. I had microphone boost turned on because otherwise I couldn't use the computer mic before without it, turns out this just seems to introduce hideous amounts of noise.</p>]]></content>

<p>Okay it seems I won't be able to do daily drawings. It's too much work editing and uploading. By Friday I felt so horrible I was practically useless all day and that kind of reverberated through the weekend. I can draw daily, it's just the rest that kills me. So I'm thinking of like doing a weekly progress thing or every few days post whatever I've been working on like here.</p>
<p>This took 2-3 days and 3 hours total.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made a camera rig (you can see it in the first video below) for filming traditional sketches. It’s a bulky solution but it works well regardless of how comical it looks. I don’t think it’s worth an instructable. All I did was stick a wall hook in the ceiling and then mess around with the rope until I got something that worked. It’s surprisingly secure. It also doesn’t cast any bothersome shadows or anything.</p>
<p>The original plan was to just hang the camera but it moved to much even if I tied it to the shelf, plus it cast a horrible shadow.</p>
<p>In the future I’m thinking I will hang it, but making some sort of arm that sticks out from the shelf to properly stabilize the camera. It doesn’t need to be bulky since it won’t bear any weight and to not get a shadow I just have to get the camera in the right position.</p>
<p>I thought about making an overhead arm for the tripod but I’m not sure how I’d attach the camera. The ways I’ve seen it done would mean that the camera would end up in portrait mode (because there’s only space to the sides for the counterweight) and you wouldn’t be able to modify it’s tilt at all.</p>
<p>If anybody has any ideas or suggestions leave me a comment.</p>

<p>I’m trying out something slightly different. I want to do more video but the editing always takes so long I avoid it. So I’m thinking of doing videos like this one, possibly even more concentrated (one hand at a time) because it’s so much easier to edit. Then maybe once I get the hang of it (and a proper mic - 50% of is getting the iPhone audio bits in sync) I’ll start making longer ones. Anyways enjoy.</p>

    <title>Final Site Design Brainstorm</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Because the first brainstorm ended up not being used (design wise) I did another one. This time I put more thought into how the mobile side would function.</p>
<p>Sometimes as designers we’re tempted to include things in our designs that look nice or can be attractive on a desktop interface, but just slow down the site and make it annoying on mobile platforms.</p>
<p>So I only left stuff to the top that I felt was useful for users. You’re usually not going to try to go through a blog’s archive tree from mobile for example. But at the same time it’s not completely inaccessible (there’s a link to the page). I think decreased functionality is just as bad as interfering functionality. By interfering functionality I mean things like the following. These are just things that annoy me as a user. Yes most phones are getting bigger screens but some of us are still stuck with 3.5 inch screens.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fixed Search/Menu Header - They are really annoying on screens smaller than 3.5 inches (original iPhone size).</p></li>
<li><p>Popups - Don’t, just no, don’t do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Lightboxes - I have mixed opinions about these. If they’re super fast they’re great, but otherwise they suck. It’s a fine line. I ended up using inline thumbnails and pictures with easy links to the full image.</p></li>
<li><p>Un-hoverable Menus - Make sure if you have menus they “hover” when tapped once on mobile devices instead of going straight to the link or appearing then disappearing.</p></li>
<li><p>Infinite Scrolling - I would strongly advice against it. 90% of sites with infinite scrolling still crash my iPod Touch (4th gen). Even on a desktop this is a bad idea if users are likely to scroll past the 3rd-4th page (who doesn’t want their users to read a lot?). Each page that you load is added to the memory and therefore slows down the site. There will be a point at which it becomes sluggish on almost any device. The only way you might get away with infinite scrolling is if you only have text.</p></li>
<li><p>No Next/Previous Gestures - I don’t know who thought this was a good idea, but some blogs allow you to “turn” to the next post. But all that happens is that you accidently turn a page when you don’t want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything that messes with the font size when rotating the device.</p></li>
</ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Flickr has a large collection of photos from museums and such that are out of copyright or with no known copyright restrictions. You could go to the individual museums but it’s much easier to search them through Flickr. Anyways, I will occasionally search such images. They’re usually old and rather boring but occasionally there will be some interesting ones like the two above.</p>
<p>I had actually planned on sketching the faces and everything as well with the first sketch, but I had started with the shirts, finished those first, and I just loved how they looked without hands/faces so I left them like that. Both sketches were also drawn with the figures closer than they actually were which I think gives them a strange dynamic. I like how it ended up so much I’m thinking of doing a painting in a similar style.</p>
<p>Here’s the original image for comparison:</p>
<p><a href="https://flic.kr/p/5FuLtH"><div class="lazy-wrapper"><img src="https://alansartlog.com/resources/uploads/flickr-two-people-fencing.jpg"  width="500" height="384"  alt="Two People Fencing" /></div></a></p>
<p>The second one is more similar to the original because I wasn’t quite sure where to stop. I didn’t draw their faces, but everything else was covered and therefore you don’t get the same effect from just drawing the clothing / inanimate objects.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, sketches from now on have accurate dates. Before I only used the month or the date I edited them. Still, I’ve changed the post date so that they don’t sink below the sketchdump.</p>
<p>Anyways, as you can see I’ve made more notes. I’m trying to keep all my sketches clean and presentable like I talked about in my resolutions post.</p>
<p>Now I struggled a bit with the dark shading in the tree sketch and I want to mention this because it just so happened I had started to read a <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4302170W/Course_in_pencil_sketching">Course in Pencil Sketching by Ernest Watson</a>, and it mentioned something interesting that I’d never considered and that is the surface on which you’re drawing and whether it’s hard/soft. I would usually draw on a hard surface because you can get more precise lines, but as the book explains this is a horrible surface for shading.</p>
<p>So those blocks of shading at the bottom are me experimenting with different surfaces and pencil combinations. My favorite where the last two. I used a 4B (Lyra) pencil and did two passes over two surfaces (4 &amp; 2 paper towels thick). The order didn’t seem to matter. I’m not going to do that for all sketches, but it’s something to keep in mind for large areas of black like the grass. For general sketches I’ve moved over to drawing over a plastic folder filled with paper (where I keep my sketches).</p>
<p>I still have to try those notes/to-do’s I left myself.</p>]]></content>

<p>I was doing a very realistic portrait from scratch and I was having some trouble with the ear so I thought I’d do some ear studies and record it while I’m at it. The best way really to learn how to draw something is to draw it until you can draw it without reference. There’s no way around the hard boring work that studies can be. Looking at videos and posts will help guide you on what to observe and pay attention to, and mistakes to avoid, but nothing can replace practice.</p>
<p>A great place to get reference images for studies is <a href="http://morguefile.com/">morgueFile</a>. You could also look around Flickr and such for CC licensed images but if you’ll be posting your work anywhere, those require crediting. morgueFile was made with artists in mind, as long as you modify the image you can do whatever you want with your work and that can be useful so you can just worry about doing your study and not whether you can share it later or you have to attach a giant list of credits.</p>
<h1 id="updatenbsppart2isup201512somenotesonearspart2"><a href="/2015/12/some-notes-on-ears-part-2">Update:&nbsp;Part 2 is up!</a></h1>
<p>I planned on talking about how to paint the ear and how it can be lit up from behind (subsurface scattering), but the video was too long already. I’ll do a second one and repost this post when I upload it. I’ve got some cool stuff ready for that video.</p>
<p>I think, I hope. This video was kind of nightmare to make. My computer was throwing blue screens. Turns out the damn video cache was in the wrong place. Also my internet sucks and the files are huge. Just want to mention this because I discovered this cool site called <a href="https://clipchamp.com/">clipchamp</a> that compresses your videos extremely well. I mean, it’s kind of astonishing. Even set on high quality it shrunk a 380MB file to 60MB! (ignore the estimate they give it’s way off). And you can queue the YouTube upload, so you can leave it to do the whole process overnight. I’m sure Premiere can probably compress as well, but I’m not very familiar with all the export settings and this is super easy.</p>]]></content>

I ended up not to happy with the above at first. I lean towards realism so it’s hard for me to be loose with details. Also my canvas was smaller than it should have been looking back now.</p>
<p>I was going to give it another try and got halfway through:</p>

<p>But then I left the paintings sitting for a bit and I ended up liking the first more so I left the second alone. I’m posting it because it’s interesting seeing that in-between step.</p>]]></content>

It’s more the size you see in the sketchbook thumb.
